A03_B01_002_010="Despite my planning, seizing the planet has proven much more difficult than expected. This is unacceptable. You will go to Matar and relieve Crusader Eris. She has been in constant battle and is in need of rest. "
A03_B01_003_010="I assume that the Princess has no objection with this strategy, Toth?"
A03_B01_003_020="No. She objects to the wholesale slaughter of innocent civilians."
A03_B01_003_030="No one is innocent in this war, Toth. Everyone has blood on their hands. You have your orders, Knight. Carry them out."
A03_D01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Choir to Knight, respond. Choir to Knight, please respond.  We've lost your signal, please respond."
A03_M01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Crusader Eris, the Avatar-of-War thanks you for your efforts on behalf of the Illuminate. You are relieved and may return to base."
A03_M01_010_020="[{i Eris}]: Knight, the UEF army is massing for another attack. You need to prepare your defenses. Eris out."
A03_M01_010_030="[{i Choir}]: Move quickly to repair and rebuild, Commander. Strengthen your defensive line! Choir out."
A03_M01_020_010="[{i Choir}]: Sensors indicate that the UEF forces are prepping for a major assault on your position. You only have a few minutes. Choir out."
A03_M01_030_010="[{i Choir}]: An attack force of light air units is inbound. Choir out."
A03_M01_040_010="[{i Choir}]: You are running out of time. The UEF attack is imminent. Choir out."

A03_M01_070_010="[{i Toth}]: The UEF is coming."
A03_M01_070_020="[{i Arnold}]: Now you will pay for your crimes against humanity!"
A03_M01_080_010="[{i Choir}]: You have defeated the first wave. Our intel states that the UEF Commander will use ground units the next time he attacks. Choir Out. "
A03_M01_090_010="[{i Arnold}]: The Aeon's days are numbered. The UEF will emerge victorious."
A03_M01_100_010="[{i Choir}]: The second wave has been repelled. Sensors indicate the UEF Commander is constructing a substantial naval force. Be prepared for an attack from the sea. Choir out."
A03_M01_110_010="[{i Arnold}]: Time to take off the gloves."
A03_M01_120_010="[{i Choir}]: You have held off the UEF assault. The Avatar will be pleased to hear of your success. Choir out."
A03_M01_120_020="[{i Arnold}]: I'll be damned. Maybe you ain't a pansy after all."

A03_M02_010_010="[{i Choir}]: It is now time to strike back. Your main target is the UEF Commander. There are three UEF bases on the islands surrounding your position. The enemy Commander is at one of those bases. Find and eliminate him. Choir out."
A03_M02_020_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF Commander is utilizing a personal Quantum Teleportation Upgrade. We are scanning to determine his location. Choir out."
A03_M02_030_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF Commander has teleported to the northern island. Choir out."
A03_M02_040_010="[{i Choir}]: We found him. He has teleported to the southern island. Press the attack. Choir out."
A03_M02_050_010="[{i Choir}]: We have traced him to the southeastern island. Move into attack position. Choir out."
A03_M02_060_010="[{i Choir}]: The land base is no longer a threat, Knight. Choir out."

A03_M03_020_010="[{i Toth}]: Harmony to you, Knight. I apologize for this interruption, but the Princess wishes to speak to you. It is a matter of great importance."
A03_M03_020_020="[{i Princess}]: Hello, Knight. We have not yet had the pleasure of a proper introduction, but I have something important to tell you. The UEF Commander that you face is named Zachary Arnold. He holds the key to our future. When he faces defeat, he will surrender to you. Once he lays down his arms, you will bring him to me. I am placing my trust in you, Knight."
A03_M03_030_010="[{i Choir}]: We have detected a large naval force gathering at the UEF base. They are moving into attack position--prepare for a naval assault. Choir out."
A03_M03_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: You will never conquer Matar."
A03_M03_050_010="[{i Choir}]: The naval force has been defeated. Continue your assault against Commander Arnold."
A03_M03_060_010="[{i Marxon}]: I have been informed that the Princess has contacted you, Knight. You are to ignore her. I am your commanding officer, and there will be serious repercussions if you disobey me. Is that clear?"
A03_M03_070_010="[{i Princess}]: Do not concern yourself with Avatar Marxon. I have foreseen your future. You are safe. Continue with your mission, Commander."
A03_M03_080_010="[{i Choir}]: The UEF Commander cannot flee from you much longer, Knight. Your victory will be swift. Choir out. "

A03_M03_090_020="[{i Princess}]: You need not die, Commander Arnold. Your fate lies elsewhere. Listen to my words. You know I speak the truth."
A03_M03_090_030="[{i Arnold}]: Yes...now I understand..."
A03_M03_090_040="[{i Princess}]: It is as I have seen. Secure Commander Arnold, Knight. I eagerly await your arrival."

A03_T01_020_010="[{i Arnold}]: The UEF will never surrender to the Aeon."
A03_T01_030_010="[{i Arnold}]: You are a fanatic."
A03_T01_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: The end game is approaching. You will lose."
A03_T01_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: The UEF will save the galaxy from you fanatics."

A04_B01_000_010="Date: 29-AUGUST-3844"
A04_B01_001_010="Harmony to you, Knight. You performed well on Matar, but the situation has become complicated. Commander Arnold was personally enlightened by the Princess, but he revealed some troubling news. "
A04_B01_002_010="The UEF is constructing a weapon of horrific power called Black Sun. It can destroy entire planets. Avatar Marxon is already lobbying for an all-out attack on Earth."
A04_B01_003_010="Hello, Knight. I wish we could meet under better circumstances. The Avatar's war drums are getting louder, and it will be difficult to hold him in check."
A04_B01_003_020="That is why the Princess has removed you from the service of Avatar Marxon. From this day forward, you will serve the Princess directly. You will be her Champion."
A04_B01_004_010="This is Procyon, a planet deep in Cybran territory. We know little of it save its name."
A04_B01_004_020="In my meditations, I have sensed something there, some...other. I cannot describe it, but it troubles me greatly. You must go to Procyon and discover what it is."
A04_B01_005_010="Fear not, Champion. I sense greatness in you. "
A04_B01_005_020="You gate to Procyon immediately. Go forth with grace, Champion of the Illuminate."
A04_D01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Choir to Champion, respond. Choir to Champion, please respond. We've lost your signal, please respond."
A04_M01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, there is a Cybran settlement called Nexus04 to your north. The Princess does not want the population cleansed, but you are to eliminate all military resistance within the settlement. Choir out."
A04_M01_020_010="[{i Elliott}]: Attention all Cybran Commanders. This is Director Elliott at Node73. An Aeon Commander has just landed southeast of Nexus04. We need assistance! The Aeon will murder us all!"
A04_M01_020_020="[{i Choir}]: Champion, there is a facility called Node73 to your northwest. It appears to house a data-relay station of unknown purpose. Proceed to the facility and capture the 'Node'. Choir out."
A04_M01_030_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, we detect a Cybran naval base on the lake to the west. Naval units are forming a blockade on the river in order to cut off access to it. You are not required to destroy the naval base; attack at your discretion. Choir out."
A04_M01_040_010="[{i Choir}]: The Cybran naval base has been eliminated. The lake is now secure. Choir out."
A04_M01_050_010="[{i Choir}]: We are detecting incoming Cybran units. Prepare for battle. Choir out."
A04_M01_060_010="[{i Gauge}]: This will be your final day."
A04_M01_070_010="[{i Choir}]: The Cybran presence here is stronger than we anticipated. We are uploading the 'Shield of Light' Tech 2 Shield Generator schematic into your ACU. The shield generator was designed to protect you from general ordinance, such as artillery and bombs. Choir out."
A04_M01_080_010="[{i Gauge}]: Your days of hunting Symbionts are coming to an end."
A04_M01_090_010="[{i Gauge}]: Don't think I'm going to let you have that, fanatic."
A04_M01_100_010="[{i Choir}]: The Node is heavily defended by artillery, so we are giving you the 'Asylum' Tech 2 Mobile Shield Generator schematic. Construct a few of them; they should let your units get close to the enemy without taking too much damage. Choir out."
A04_M01_110_010="[{i Choir}]: Nexus04 is no longer a threat. Advance and capture the Node. Choir out."
A04_M01_120_010="[{i Elliott}]: This is Director Elliott. The Aeon are assaulting Node73...someone do something! The Aeon are right on top of us!"
A04_M01_120_020="[{i Gauge}]: Keep your pants on. I've got units inbound to your position."
A04_M01_130_010="[{i Choir}]: Remember, Champion, you need only defeat the war machines in the settlement. Choir out. "
A04_M01_135_010="[{i Choir}]: The Princess is worried that pacifying Nexus04 is taking too long, Champion. Is there a problem? Choir out."
A04_M01_140_010="[{i Choir}]: The Princess has ordered that the Node be captured ASAP, Champion. Choir out. "
A04_M01_145_010="[{i Choir}]: The success of the mission hinges on capturing the Node in a timely fashion, Champion. Choir out."
A04_M01_150_010="[{i Choir}]: The Node has been captured. The techs are preparing to connect to it via a Quantum uplink. Choir out."
A04_M01_OBJ_010_010="Pacify Nexus04"
A04_M01_OBJ_010_011="Destroy all war machines present in the settlement. It is not necessary to destroy the settlement itself."
A04_M01_OBJ_010_020="Capture the Node"
A04_M01_OBJ_010_021="There is a Facility to the northwest built around a Node. Its purpose is unknown, so capture the Node and uncover the Cybrans' plans."
A04_M01_OBJ_020_010="Destroy the Cybran Naval Base"
A04_M01_OBJ_020_015="Do not let the enemy establish a base in your sector. Send your forces across the lake and destroy the enemy base."

A04_M01_OBJ_020_065="All three Nodes survive."
A04_M02_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Our technicians have been unable to penetrate deeper into the Node network. The Nodes simply provide processing power for a larger Mainframe to the north. The Mainframe is heavily defended, but our technicians have been able to isolate and neutralize all nearby defensive structures. Capture the Mainframe so our technicians can continue their work. Once the Mainframe has been captured, the surrounding defenses will come under your control. Choir out."
A04_M02_020_010="[{i Choir}]: We have hacked into the Mainframe and are investigating. Protect the Mainframe at all costs. Choir out."
A04_M02_030_010="[{i Choir}]: Node 72 has been captured. Begin constructing defenses around it. Choir out."
A04_M02_040_010="[{i Choir}]: Node 74 has been captured. Reinforce the position as you see fit. Choir out."
A04_M02_050_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, the Cybrans are attempting to cut the Mainframe off from the Network! You must protect the Nodes in our sector until we have extracted the data that we need. Capture the Nodes and then defend them from Cybran attack. Choir out."
A04_M02_050_020="[{i Gauge}]: Not today, Aeon!"
A04_M02_060_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, our technicians unlocked some of the Node's functions and have located an algorithm. Each Node you control increases resource production. Capture all three for the maximum benefit. Choir out."
A04_M02_070_010="[{i Choir}]: Cybran attacks are incoming! They appear to be focused on the Mainframe, but don't forget about defending the Nodes. Choir out."
A04_M02_080_010="[{i Choir}]: The technicians are still working, Champion. Continue to defend the Nodes! Choir out."
A04_M02_090_010="[{i Choir}]: The technicians are getting close, but they need more time! Choir out."
A04_M02_100_010="[{i Choir}]: They're almost done. The technicians just need a little more time! Choir out."
A04_M02_110_010="[{i Choir}]: A Node has been destroyed, but we're still using the other two Nodes. Protect them! Choir out."
A04_M02_120_010="[{i Choir}]: A second Node has been lost. We cannot lose any more! Our mission will end in failure if we lose the last Node! Choir out."
A04_M02_130_010="[{i Choir}]: The Mainframe is key to the Princess' plan. Capture it ASAP, Champion. Choir out. "
A04_M02_135_010="[{i Choir}]: The technicians are ready to begin investigating the Mainframe, but you need to capture it first, Champion. Choir out."
A04_M02_140_010="[{i Choir}]: The Nodes must be captured so the technicians can continue their work, Champion. Choir out. "
A04_M02_145_010="[{i Choir}]: We must have full access to the Cybran network if we are to uncover their secrets, Champion. Capture those Nodes ASAP. Choir out."
A04_M02_150_010="[{i Choir}]: We've lost all the Nodes. The mission cannot be completed. Abort and return home, Champion. Choir out."
A04_M02_160_010="[{i Princess}]: The veil has been lifted and now I...understand. Return home, Champion. There is much to discuss."
A04_M02_OBJ_010_010="Capture and Defend the Mainframe"
A04_M02_OBJ_010_015="The Mainframe should have the information the Princess requires. You must capture and defend the Mainframe while technicians work on deciphering its contents."
A04_M02_OBJ_010_020="Capture and Defend All Three Nodes."
A04_M02_OBJ_010_025="The Nodes are critical to the operation, the technicians will use them to access the Mainframe and search its databanks. Capture the remaining Nodes and then defend all of them. If all the Nodes are lost, the technicians will be unable to access the Mainframe and the operation will fail. Expect the Cybrans to attack with air, land, and naval units."
A04_T01_010_010="[{i Gauge}]: Procyon will be your tomb."
A04_T01_020_010="[{i Gauge}]: We will never bow down to your madness."
A04_T01_030_010="[{i Gauge}]: Your fanaticism is destroying the galaxy."
A04_T01_040_010="[{i Gauge}]: Today you die."
A04_T01_050_010="[{i Gauge}]: Grrrrrr."
A04_T01_060_010="[{i Gauge}]: The Way is nothing more than a fairy tale."
A04_T01_070_010="[{i Gauge}]: There is nothing here for you except death."

A05_B01_000_010="DATE: 09-SEPTEMBER-3844"
A05_B01_001_010="You performed well on Procyon, Champion, but there are more ill tidings. The Cybrans are preparing to deploy a Quantum Virus via Black Sun. The Virus will destroy the Gate Network. "
A05_B01_002_005="Marxon learned of the Cybran super weapon through one of his agents and immediately launched an all-out assault against the UEF. Avatar Marxon has lost all reason. "
A05_B01_002_007="Marxon is not enlightening. He has abandoned The Way and has ordered his Commanders to slaughter everyone, military and civilian alike. Marxon's strength lies in the Commanders that follow him, but we believe that many will abandon him if given the opportunity.  "
A05_B01_003_010="This is Eridani. It is deep in UEF territory, and Crusaders Rhiza and Ariel have launched attacks on the planet, sowing destruction on Marxon's orders. You will go to Eridani and press the Princesses' case. All who refuse you must be silenced."
A05_B01_003_020="Rhiza, despite her flaws, is a firm believer in The Way and is well respected in the military. If she abandons the Avatar, many others will follow. Ariel is an enigma. I do not know her mind."
A05_B01_004_010="One last word, my Champion. The \"otherness\" I sensed on Procyon is an AI that was created by the Cybrans. The AI uses the Quantum Gate Network as part of its consciousness. It is the reason my visions have been cloudy. News of the Cybran's plan has given me an idea: Could I also use Black Sun to move my consciousness into the Quantum Realm? I would use Black Sun's power to connect with every human in the galaxy. And end the Infinite War."
A05_B01_005_019="We now believe that our ancestors were wrong to start this conflict. The original teachings of the Seraphim have been corrupted, and The Way is now little more than a weapon. The Princess will correct this. I began the process by ensuring her placement on the throne, and now you will be her sword. Go forth and show Marxon how a true believer in The Way fights."
A05_D01_010_010="[{i Choir}]: Choir to Champion, respond. Choir to Champion, please respond. We've lost your signal, please respond."
A05_M01_010_010="[{i Princess}]: Crusaders, stay your weapons. Your Princess, Rhianne Burke, commands it. The Avatar-of-War has overstepped his authority and now acts against the wishes of the Illuminate. I call upon you to refuse his orders and uphold the truth of The Way."
A05_M01_010_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Yes, my Princess. I will gladly serve your champion. "
A05_M01_010_030="[{i Princess}]: And what say you, Crusader Ariel?"
A05_M01_010_040="[{i Ariel}]: The UEF stands on the brink of defeat. That is the Avatar's doing, Princess, not yours. I stand with Marxon and will destroy any who threaten him."
A05_M01_010_050="[{i Princess}]: I am truly saddened by what must be done. Champion, the civilians are to be protected at all costs. As for Crusader Ariel, you will end her rampage."
A05_M01_010_060="[{i Choir}]: Champion, the Princess has ordered you to protect the civilians. Crusader Rhiza will act as your support-commander. She will help rebuild and repair your base. Choir out."
A05_M01_020_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Ariel was constructing a squadron of bombers. You must protect the colonies with Heavy Shield Generators. I will upload the schematic to you. "
A05_M01_020_030="[{i Choir}]: We confirm that Ariel is constructing a squadron of bombers. These markers display the optimal shield placement points. Build a Heavy Shield Generator as indicated. Choir out. "
A05_M01_030_010="[{i Blake}]: Dammit, more Aeon!"
A05_M01_030_020="[{i Princess}]: We mean you no harm, Commander Blake. We merely wish to save these colonies."
A05_M01_030_030="[{i Blake}]: Like hell. I know how you freaks \"save\" colonies. "
A05_M01_030_040="[{i Princess}]: Please, listen to my words. We need not fight one another."
A05_M01_030_050="[{i Blake}]: Don't try that mystic rubbish with me. It isn't going to work!"

A05_M01_070_010="[{i Ariel}]: Hmmm, well enough, I suppose. But how will she fare against strategic missiles? "
A05_M01_070_020="[{i Choir}]: Sensors show that Ariel is building a Strategic Missile Launcher. We are uploading the schematic for the 'Patron' Tech 3 Strategic Missile Defense to your ACU. Construct a missile defense facility at each of the indicated points. Choir out. "

A05_M01_090_010="[{i Ariel}]: It is time to end this. "
A05_M01_090_020="[{i Choir}]: Ariel has launched a nuclear missile! Choir out."
A05_M01_100_010="[{i Ariel}]: I will have to do this the traditional way."
A05_M01_100_020="[{i Choir}]: Ariel is attacking the eastern colony with air power. Scramble fighters and anti-air units to protect it. Choir out."

A05_M01_120_010="[{i Choir}]: Ariel is now attacking both colonies with combined air and land assets. Protect the colonies! Choir out."
A05_M01_130_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Princess!"
A05_M01_140_010="[{i Choir}]: Champion, you still have not deployed all the Strategic Missile Defenses! You must move quickly! Choir out."
A05_M01_145_010="[{i Choir}]: The colonies are still not protected with Strategic Missile Defenses. You must build them quickly! Choir out."
A05_M01_150_010="[{i Choir}]: There have been too many civilian casualties--the other Commanders have abandoned us for Marxon. Abort and return. Choir out."

C05_B01_005_010="He dares blackmail us? The Seven Hand Node is nothing but a pack of thieves. We should let him rot--"
C05_B01_005_020="No choice. We must secure those codes. No matter the risk or cost."
C05_B01_005_030="Commander, you will free Hex5's comrades and get the Black Sun's access codes."
C05_B01_006_010="We are running out of time, my boy. Out of time. The UEF will fall to the Aeon within 14 days.

Destroy the Power Generators in the UEF base to your south. That will drop the prison's shields and let me get in and rescue my friends. I'll be in touch once they're safe. Hex5 out."
C05_M01_010_020="[{i Ops}]: You know your objectives, Commander. Establish a defensive perimeter and start building units as rapidly as possible. Do not attack the UEF until you have a large army. Ops out."

C05_M02_010_020="[{i Ops}]: This keeps getting better and better. There are three Omni-Sensors in the area: to the south; the southwest; and northwest. Destroy them. We need those codes! Ops out."

C06_M01_010_020="[{i Ops}]: Sir, it looks like the Aeon are building some sort of...flying saucer. We don't know what it's capable of, but it's a safe bet it'll attack Black Sun. Destroy it before it can take off. It cannot be allowed to reach Black Sun! Ops out."
C06_M01_020_010="[{i Jericho}]: Commander, we've tapped into the UEF communication system. Black Sun hasn't been completed, but it's close. I'll keep you updated on its progress."

Sentimentality has no place on the battlefield. All you need do is follow The Way as outlined by our ancestors. That is all the guidance anyone requires."
CAMPDEB_0003="From: Evaluator Toth\nTo: Her Highness, Princess Rhianne\nPrincess, I bear grave news. The one I was to watch, the one you had such hopes for, has failed. She was unable to complete her mission on Zeta Canis. It is a great blow, I know. I had begun to think she was the one. Marxon continues his ways. He has even approached some of the other Avatars, seeking to increase his power. I fear he will soon have too much support and become unstoppable. I will do what I can."
CAMPDEB_0004="From: Princess Burke\nTo: Evaluator Toth\nCc: Knight {g PlayerName}\n I have succeeded. The UEF Colonel, Zachary Arnold, has accepted The Way. He resisted far longer than I expected, but he eventually realized the Truth. His conversion, as pleasing as it is, has made our lives more difficult. He spoke to me of the UEF and its plans, of a terrible weapon being constructed. This news will only serve to bring more Commanders to Marxon's side and strengthen his power. How are we to find peace when it seems all anyone else wants is war and destruction?"
CAMPDEB_0005="From: Princess Burke\nTo: Knight {g PlayerName}\nKnight, I would like to thank you for your efforts on Matar. I realize I put you in a difficult position and that you did your best to secure the UEF Commander. I know there was something I was to learn from him, but hopefully, there will be another opportunity in the future."
CAMPDEB_0006="From: Evaluator Toth\nTo: Champion {g PlayerName}\nYou have done the Princess a great service, Champion. It seems that everyday, more and more people flock to Marxon's banner. The Princess is hard pressed and I fear not only for her, but for all of our people. She will need your strength in the days to come. I will do what I can, but I feel that I will not see the end of this struggle. Keep Rhianne safe, Champion, the future must belong to her."
CAMPDEB_0007="From: Evaluator Toth\nTo: Her Highness, Princess Rhianne\nPrincess, the failure of your Champion on Procyon has left you in a perilous state. Marxon has used this to further erode your position. He argues that if your chosen Champion is weak, then by extension, you are as well. Others are listening, and more move to stand behind Marxon every day. If we are to stop him, then something must be done soon!"
CAMPDEB_0008="From: Princess Burke\nTo: Champion {g PlayerName}\nWith your victory over Ariel, and Rhiza's abandonment of Marxon, the great majority of Commanders have disavowed themselves of the Avatar. Indeed, many in the government have publicly proclaimed their support for me. This is all thanks to you and your deeds on my behalf. However, we cannot stop now. To ensure the future, Marxon must be brought to justice for his crimes. Only then will the galaxy truly be saved."
CAMPDEB_0009="From: Evaluator Toth\nFlee, Rhianne! Marxon is staging a coup d'état! His followers have already murdered several of your supporters and I fear they will come for you next! I will try to lead them away, but I do not know how long I can distract them! Flee! Please! You must survive for all our sakes!"
CAMPDEB_0010="From: General Samantha Clarke\nTo: Princess Rhianne Burke\nCc: Champion {g PlayerName}\n I do not know if this will reach you, Princess, but I hope it does. I don't quite know what to say. It is strange, being at peace. My mind is still full of orders and strategies. I keep expecting field reports to arrive and bring news of fresh attacks. All I can say is that I wish I had known. I spoke with Dr. Brackman the other day. He is as stunned as I am. We are moving to formally recognize the Cybran Nation. It should not take long. I hope that I will get a chance to speak to you someday. I think I will enjoy peace."
CAMPDEB_0011="Princess Rhianne Burke\nPrivate Journal\nEarth is gone. We were so close, but in the end, my Champion could not stop Marxon. Just as he was about to fire Black Sun, UEF President Riley destroyed Earth rather than be defeated. Billions are dead. There can be no peace now. I am forced to name a new Avatar-of-War. Operations against the Cybrans will continue. I will be known as the Princess who defeated the UEF and purged the Cybrans from the galaxy. I will be revered not for peace, but for war. I wish Toth were here. I wish there was another way. I wish I had never become Princess."
CAMPDEB_0012="With the defeat of the Cybrans on Capella, UEF Disaster Response Teams were quick to land and begin cleanup operations. Almost 40% of the Symbiont population was reported missing and any remaining Symbionts received thorough psychological and AI examinations to ensure that no 'Trojan Horse' programs were left behind. Overall civilian casualties were light and property damage was minimal. Note: Dr. Eric Sweeney, a noted scientist and Quantum Theorist, was reported missing. Statements taken from his coworkers suggest the Cybrans may have kidnapped him. More data will be posted as it is made available."
CAMPDEB_0013="Though eventually driven off by Colonel Zachary Arnold, the Cybrans had almost free reign across Capella for at least 11 hours. During that time, nearly 95% of the Symbiont population was abducted, leaving local industry critically short of manpower. Additionally, numerous public buildings were raided and destroyed, including a research facility. Director Marcus Thompson, despite leading a heroic defense of his facility, was killed in a bombing run, as was the greater part of his staff. Listed among the missing is Dr. Eric Sweeney, a noted scientist and Quantum Theorist."
CAMPDEB_0014="Despite the advantage of a two hour head start, Aeon forces were unable to make any progress towards occupying Luthien. Colonel Zachary Arnold led the defense of Station Lima Foxtrot and the evacuation of Luthien Colony. Both the Colony and the Station suffered only light damage and civilian losses were minimal. The Aeon Commander, despite a formidable base, was defeated and the Aeon have made no further attempts to occupy the planet."
CAMPDEB_0015="Despite heroic efforts by UEF personnel, Luthien was lost to Aeon invaders. Communication logs indicate that Station Lima Foxtrot was destroyed, with all personnel either declared dead or captured by the Aeon. Constable Keiichi Nakamura led the defense of Luthien Colony for nearly 24 hours before it was overwhelmed. Constable Nakamura has been posthumously awarded the UEF Cross 1st Class for his valor and leadership. All contact with Luthien has been lost."
CAMPDEB_0016="Although Matar was the scene of a hotly contested battle, UEF forces were victorious in driving the Aeon invaders from the planet. Notable was the presence of the Princess' Champion, who was defeated after a tough battle in the Gulf region. Despite the UEF victory, there is much sorrow over the loss of Colonel Zachary Arnold, a 22-year veteran and one of the UEF's best field commanders. President Riley has ordered all flags at half-mast for one week and will personally speak at the Colonel's memorial service."
CAMPDEB_0017="Despite a 14-hour battle on multiple fronts, Matar was lost to the Aeon. Included among the dead was Colonel Zachary Arnold, a 22-year veteran and one of the UEF's best field commanders. President Riley has ordered all flags at half-mast for one week and will personally speak at the Colonel's memorial service. All contact with Matar has been lost and it is presumed that the Aeon are currently capturing or murdering the remaining civilian population."
CAMPDEB_0018="Desperate to find a solution to the Cybran Gate Virus, the UEF dispatched Captain {g PlayerName} to Minerva, the largest Cybran colony ever found. There Captain {g PlayerName}, despite continued Cybran attacks, found not only data on the Virus, but also rescued Dr. Eric Sweeney, who was kidnapped during the fight for Capella. Dr. Sweeney had further information: Dr. Brackman himself was on Minerva. Despite a valiant effort, Brackman managed to escape, but his facility and current research were destroyed. With the return of Captain {g PlayerName} and the successful completion of his mission, the UEF has the tools it needs to continue the fight against the enemies of Earth."
CAMPDEB_0019="Desperate to find a solution to the Cybran Gate Virus, the UEF dispatched Captain {g PlayerName} to Minerva, the largest Cybran colony ever found. Despite all precautions, Captain {g PlayerName} was unable to find the necessary research. UEF Quantum Specialists warn that the Cybran Virus is continuing to spread across the Gates and will completely infest the Quantum Gate Network within 20 solar days. Further operations on Minerva are unlikely."
CAMPDEB_0020="Despite attacks by both Aeon and Cybran forces, Captain {g PlayerName} safeguarded the research facilities on Pisces IV and delivered vital materials for Project: Black Sun to Earth. Withstanding both nuclear and conventional assault, the Commander stood firm against the invaders and ensured the future of the UEF."
CAMPDEB_0021="UEF Command announced a minor setback today, the loss of Pisces IV. Home to a small colony and R&D facilities, Pisces IV was attacked by both Aeon and Cybran forces. Captain {g PlayerName} was sent to contain the Aeon attack and was pushing back when he was blindsided by a covert Cybran force. Despite the uneven odds, Captain {g PlayerName} continued a valiant defense before being forced off the planet. UEF Command reassures its citizens that this is an isolated incident and that they expect to retake the planet soon."
CAMPDEB_0022="UEF Command has proclaimed victory in the Infinite War! The war is over! Despite a massive Aeon invasion and Cybran attacks, the UEF held firm and fired a secret weapon, Project: Black Sun, which destroyed both the Aeon homeworld of Seraphim II and several Cybran core worlds. The Aeon Princess and Dr. Gustaf Brackman both offered their immediate surrender. A new day has dawned across the galaxy! The UEF is victorious!"
CAMPDEB_0023="A glorious new light has come to the UEF. With the fall of UEF Command, the Aeon have taken up the reins of the galaxy. Avatar-of-War Marxon has assured the citizens of the UEF that their lives can only improve under Aeon leadership. Disease, poverty and social inequality are all unknowns in the Illuminate and we are certain to reap the benefits of their enlightened and advanced civilization. Long live the Illuminate!"
CAMPDEB_0024="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nIt appears that Dr. Brackman was correct in his assessment of your abilities. I admit to some doubt, but am pleased to have been proven wrong. All Symbionts from Theban 2 have been rescued and are being integrated into the Nation. Jericho, in particular, has been most eager to help and has volunteered for field duty. Perhaps you will see him again one day. Rest for now, Commander, you will be needed again soon."
CAMPDEB_0025="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Doctor Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\nI am afraid your protégé did not perform as expected. He failed in his primary objectives and as a result, very few Symbionts were rescued from Theban 2. I would not recommend this Commander for further duties at this time."
CAMPDEB_0026="From: Brackman\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nExcellent work, my boy, excellent work! We will certainly put this Tech to good use, oh yes. It pleases me to no end that we were able to snatch the Aeon's most beloved artifacts right out from under them. It is too bad about Mach, but this just shows how powerful this technology is. It's quite amazing, oh yes."
CAMPDEB_0027="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Dr. Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\n I am certain that you already know, Doctor, that your protégé failed on Orionis. It was, perhaps, foolish to send him, but we cannot look back. We are considering another attempt on Orionis, but with the Aeon alerted, it will require a full scale invasion, something we cannot afford. The techs are looking for alternative targets, but nothing has come up so far. I will let you know the moment we have news."
CAMPDEB_0028="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\nYou did well on Minerva, Commander. Dr. Brackman, all of us, are pleased with how you handled yourself. The mayor of York18 has even sent his personal thanks for your performance. As you no doubt know, the war is coming to a head. The Aeon are pressing the UEF and we cannot let them win. Now is the time for us to make our move and you will lead the charge. Enjoy yourself, Commander, you have earned it."
CAMPDEB_0029="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Dr. Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\n I am pleased to hear that you escaped Minerva. The UEF are still there, no doubt ransacking whatever they can find. I think we must forget about Minerva. Now that the UEF knows about it, they will monitor it for any sign of activity. They are nothing if not persistent. Your protégé failed in his mission. It was, in truth, a difficult fight, but I am not certain that he can be trusted for further frontline operations. He can, of course, continue as a Commander, but only if the missions are of secondary importance. Let me know your thoughts."
CAMPDEB_0030="From: QAI\nTo: Dr. Brackman; Elite Commander Dostya; Commander {g PlayerName}\nRe: Status\nMy systems have been thoroughly diagnosed and all damage has been repaired. I am continuing my work on the Quantum Virus. The Aeon interference had no impact and I am .23% ahead of schedule. The Aeon purpose is still uncertain. They were obviously searching for something, but I have no reference for their motivation. All operations are proceeding as planned."
CAMPDEB_0031="From: Tech ID 227, Node Technician, Procyon\nTo: Dr. Brackman; Elite Commander Dostya; Commander {g PlayerName}\nSir, we have completed our analysis of the damage and it's bad. Not only did the Aeon have complete access to QAI's data banks, they also managed to get into the central router and traced a number of messages. We can't be certain what they got, but it's a safe to assume that they at least know where a couple dozen Nodes are. We've already sent warnings, but I don't know if that's enough. They also destroyed QAI's mainframe. We managed to salvage quite a bit, but QAI lost almost 39% of its memory. It'll be at least a year before QAI will be operating at 100% again. Awaiting further instruction."
CAMPDEB_0032="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nGlad to see you made it, Commander. I apologize for the situation with Hex5. If I had my way, he and his entire Node would be breathing vacuum, but the Doctor is much more lenient than I. We received the access codes for Black Sun and are preparing for the mission to Earth. You will lead that assault. The hopes and dreams of the entire Nation rest in your hands."
CAMPDEB_0033="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Dr. Brackman\nCc: Commander {g PlayerName}\nWe have no options left, Doctor. We cannot hope to hack Black Sun's controls before the Aeon conquer Earth. I am recommending a full evacuation. The Nation must run if it is to survive. I have asked for volunteers to stay behind with me and slow the Aeon down. We should be able to buy you at least a few months. Hopefully, something, a new plan, some brilliant insight, will occur and you will be able to save our people. Do svidanya, Doctor, it has been a privilege knowing you."
CAMPDEB_0034="From: Elite Commander Dostya\nTo: Commander {g PlayerName}\nCongratulations, Commander! You have ended the Infinite War! You no doubt have your hands full, but if you check your aft storage compartment, you will find a very good bottle of vodka. I look forward to seeing you in a few years. Dostya."
CAMPDEB_0035="To: All Cybran Commanders\nFrom: Elite Commander Dostya\nCommander {g PlayerName} failed. He was unable to spread the Quantum Virus and shut down the Gate Network. The Aeon will quickly turn its sights on us. All civilians will be evacuated to the furthest reaches of our territory. I am asking for volunteers to stay behind with me and detonate the Gates once the civilians are gone. This, combined with our delaying action, should give them some time. Make no mistake, those who volunteer will not return. "

E01_B01_002_010="Intel reports that two Cybran Commanders gated to Capella over an hour ago. We presume they're attempting to inflame the Symbiont population."
E01_B01_002_020="Why is our time being wasted with this OP? The local forces there should be able to handle it."
E01_B01_003_005="Because of President Riley's insistence that we fight across multiple fronts, we had to pull troops away from Capella for other OPs. As a result, the Research Facilities on Capella are only lightly defended. The Cybrans must not be allowed to compromise our work."
E01_B01_003_010="Are we there to secure Capella for good? Or are we going to let it fall to the Cybrans in a month?"
E01_B01_003_020="You have your orders, Colonel. You gate at 11:30 hours. Dismissed."

E01_M01_030_010="[{i Leopard11}]: The more you oppress us, the stronger we become."
E01_M01_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: Listen up, rookie. I know what they taught you at the academy regarding Cybran tactics, but you need to forget all that crap. The Cybrans are no longer running from a stand-up fight, and they're not afraid to come at you with guns blazing. Your predecessor forgot that and paid the price."
E01_M01_040_020="[{i Arnold}]: Start by building some Power Generators and Mass Extractors."
E01_M01_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: Get movin' on those Power Generators, rookie."
E01_M01_055_010="[{i Arnold}]: Without any power, you're not gonna be able to fight back."
E01_M01_060_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Sir, maybe you should check your objectives."
E01_M01_065_010="[{i Arnold}]: It's time to get into the fight! Build some Mass Extractors!"

E01_M02_020_010="[{i Arnold}]: Get that Land Factory built. We got a war to wage."
E01_M02_025_010="[{i Arnold}]: You gonna get that Land Factory built anytime soon?"

E01_M04_010_010="[{i Arnold}]: Good, now take your tanks and destroy that Cybran radar. There's a couple units defending it, but your tanks should make short work of them."
E01_M04_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: That Cybran radar isn't going to destroy itself, rookie. "
E01_M04_055_010="[{i Arnold}]: Get a move on, rookie! I need that radar down ASAP!"
E01_M04_OBJ_010_411="Destroy the Enemy Radar"
E01_M04_OBJ_010_412="Use your tanks to destroy the Cybran radar located to your southwest. To select all of your tanks, either drag-select or double-click on one of them. Right-click near the objective marker to send your tanks to that destination."
E01_M05_010_010="[{i Arnold}]: Nice work. Always build as quickly as possible; it'll save your backside if you gate into a hot LZ. Get some additional units online and destroy that air base to the southwest. There's some Cybran bombers prowling around, so take a few Mobile Anti-Air with you."
E01_M05_020_010="[{i Arnold}]: Not bad, rookie, but don't let it go to your head. Make one mistake, and the Cybrans will tear you apart."
E01_M05_020_020="[{i Arnold}]: Blast, there's another Cybran Commander. I'm gonna deal with him. The rest of this OP is yours. I'm leaving you with some reinforcements. They're a few steps above your pay grade, but that doesn't mean you can't play with 'em."
E01_M05_025_010="[{i Leopard11}]: That air base was meaningless. The larger struggle remains."
E01_M05_025_020="[{i Arnold}]: Ignore his psycho-babble."
E01_M05_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: You waitin' for that Cybran air base to fall apart on its own? "
E01_M05_055_010="[{i Arnold}]: Did you forget why we're here? Flatten that air base, pronto!"
E01_M05_OBJ_010_511="Destroy the Enemy Air Factory to the Southwest"
E01_M05_OBJ_010_512="The Lobo Mobile Artillery and Archer Mobile Anti-Air units are now available to you. Construct a force of Medium Tanks, Mobile Artillery and Mobile Anti-Air units. Destroy the Cybran Air Factory."
E01_M06_020_010="[{i Leopard11}]: You have taken out my defensive line. I won't underestimate you again."
E01_M06_050_010="[{i Arnold}]: What are you doing, takin' a nap? Get down there and take out that defensive line!"
E01_M06_055_010="[{i Arnold}]: I gave you an order to take out that defensive line, rookie. Jump to it!"
E01_M06_OBJ_010_611="Destroy all Towers Along the Defensive Line"
E01_M06_OBJ_010_612="You have received some advanced units from Colonel Arnold; use them to attack the Cybran defenses. All enemy Anti-Aircraft Turrets and Point Defenses must be destroyed."
E01_M07_010_010="[{i Arnold}]: Here's your next assignment. You need to take out the Cybran Commander. I don't care how you do it, just as long as it gets done.\n"
E01_M07_020_010="[{i Thompson}]: Commander...can you read me? This is Assistant Research Director Thompson. The Cybrans are attacking us, and I don't know how much longer our defenses will hold. I'm patching you into our systems. You'll have access to our Long-Range Radar."
E01_M07_030_010="[{i Thompson}]: Commander, we have a Light Artillery Installation available, but we don't have enough power to fire it. The Cybran has some Tech 2 Power Generators to the far west. If you can capture one of them, we can tap into your grid and fire the weapon."
E01_M07_030_020="[{i Arnold}]: I like it. Go capture one of those Tech 2 Power Generators."
E01_M07_040_010="[{i Thompson}]: Commander, we have analyzed the Cybran's base. All of their Anti-Air Towers are positioned along their southern perimeter."
E01_M07_040_020="[{i Arnold}]: That's what we needed to hear. Round up some ground forces and destroy those Anti-Air Towers, rookie. Once they're down, bomb the Cybrans back to the stone age. You should also look at getting a second base off the ground. There's a lot of Mass where the Cybran defensive line was positioned. Check it out."
E01_M07_060_010="[{i Arnold}]: Did you forget why we're here? You need to recapture the R&D Facility to the south."
E01_M07_070_010="[{i Arnold}]: Looks like the Cybran brass ain't too happy with you. Don't worry, I'll take care of 'em. You just worry about that other Commander."
E01_M07_080_010="[{i Thompson}]: We appreciate the assistance, Commander, but...oh my god...the Cybrans took Dr. Sweeney. He's one of our top researchers and key to Black Sun--"
E01_M07_080_020="[{i Arnold}]: Shut up, Thompson! You eggheads get back to what you were doing. We'll worry about Sweeney."
E01_M07_090_010="[{i Leopard11}]: Recall, dammit! Recall!"
E01_M07_090_020="[{i Arnold}]: You actually took him down. Maybe you are cut out for this."
E01_M07_100_010="[{i Leopard11}]: The Cybrans will never admit defeat."
E01_M07_110_010="[{i Thompson}]: The southern facility has been lost. All the researchers, all the work...it's all gone... "
E01_M07_130_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Sir, General Clarke sends her congratulations for successfully completing your first mission."
E01_M07_150_010="[{i Arnold}]: The R&D Facility is still under Cybran control. Get some forces down there ASAP. "
E01_M07_155_010="[{i Arnold}]: We don't want the Cybrans poking around that R&D Facility. Recapture it as soon as possible. "
E01_M07_160_010="[{i Arnold}]: I'm not hearing any Cybran ACUs cooking off, rookie."
E01_M07_165_010="[{i Arnold}]: That Cybran Commander is still kicking. Fix that."
E01_M07_170_010="[{i Arnold}]: You gonna capture that Tech 2 Generator anytime soon, rookie?"
E01_M07_175_010="[{i Arnold}]: Director Thompson is still waiting on you to capture that Tech 2 Generator. Let's not disappoint him."
E01_M07_OBJ_010_711="Defeat the Cybran Commander"
E01_M07_OBJ_010_712="The Cybran Commander must be defeated. Remember, ACUs can take a lot of damage and will auto-repair over time, so make sure you attack with a force that's large enough to finish the job."
E01_M07_OBJ_020_711="Capture One Tech 2 Power Generator"
E01_M07_OBJ_020_712="Use your ACU or an Engineer to capture a Tech 2 Power Generator. To capture, select an Engineer or an ACU, click on the 'Capture' button and then on the Generator. There are three Tech 2 Power Generators in the area, but you only need to take one of them."
E01_T01_010_010="[{i Leopard11}]: Your leaders are nothing more than liars. Do not believe their propaganda."
E01_T01_020_010="[{i Leopard11}]: How much Cybran blood is on your hands?"
E01_T01_030_010="[{i Leopard11}]: We want to be free. Is that too much to ask?"
E01_T01_040_010="[{i Leopard11}]: You and your kind sicken me. You destroy what you don't understand."
E01_T01_050_010="[{i Leopard11}]: We wanted to live in peace. You forced this war upon yourselves."
E01_T01_060_010="[{i Leopard11}]: Someday the Cybrans will control the galaxy."
E01_T01_070_010="[{i Leopard11}]: The UEF is falling apart. The old ways are dying. Time is against you."
E01_T01_080_010="[{i Leopard11}]: The UEF would enslave all Cybrans. How can you possibly support that goal?"
E02_B01_000_010="Date: 16-AUGUST-3844"
E02_B01_001_010="While you were busy on Capella, the Aeon pushed out of the Quarantine Zone and attacked our positions on Luthien. Our forces there are holding their own, but they will fall unless they're reinforced."
E02_B01_002_010="The strategic importance of Luthien cannot be overstated. The planet is rich in natural resources and home to a small Research and Development Facility that is doing work vital to the UEF; it must not fall to the Aeon."
E02_B01_003_010="Colonel Arnold will oversee the OP. Lieutenant, you will support the Colonel. Questions?"
E02_B01_003_020="How much longer am I going to be holding this guy's hand? "
E02_B01_003_030="You have your orders, Colonel."
E02_B01_004_010="A word of warning, Lieutenant. The Aeon are brain-washing monsters who have only one purpose, to spread their so-called 'Way.' Do not listen to anything they say. Attack and kill them with extreme prejudice. You gate in 30."
E02_D01_010_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Lieutenant! Come in, Lieutenant! We've lost your signal...Lieutenant, report..."
E02_M01_010_010="[{i Stenson}]: This is Director Stenson of Science Station Lima Foxtrot. Our Power Core has been breached and we are unable to repair it. If it isn't contained soon, the entire Facility will explode."
E02_M01_010_020="[{i EarthCom}]: Colonel Arnold, General Clarke's orders are to get to Station Lima Foxtrot and fix that Power Core ASAP. EarthCom out."
E02_M01_020_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Colonel Arnold has confirmed that you have constructed an Air Factory. We're uploading the schematic for the C-6 'Courier' Light Air Transport."
E02_M01_030_010="[{i Arnold}]: Use your transport to move either your Armored Command Unit or an Engineer to Lima. Scans are showing a lot of Aeon activity between you and the facility, so it's going to be hot. Clear out the enemy before you try and reach Lima. "
E02_M01_030_020="[{i Arnold}]: You're on your own, rookie."
E02_M01_040_010="[{i Arnold}]: Wait, what the...those eggheads dropped me on the wrong side of the continent! I'm no help, EarthCom, it'll be hours before I can get there. Tell Clarke the rookie will have to do it on his own!"
E02_M01_040_020="[{i EarthCom}]: Lieutenant, General Clarke has placed you in charge of the OP. Establish a base with some basic defenses and then build an Air Factory. Colonel Arnold will advise as necessary."
E02_M01_050_010="[{i Min}]: Attention Station Lima Foxtrot. This is Templar Min of the Aeon Illuminate. We have no intention of harming you. Surrender now and avoid unnecessary bloodshed."
E02_M01_050_020="[{i Arnold}]: Don't listen to her!"
E02_M01_060_010="[{i Stenson}]: The Core temperature has doubled. We can't last much longer!"
E02_M01_070_010="[{i Stenson}]: The Core is increasingly unstable. You've got to do something! There isn't much time left!"
E02_M01_080_010="[{i Stenson}]: ...the thermal shield is failing! The Core will explode any minute!"
E02_M01_080_020="[{i Arnold}]: What are you doing? Get over there and help them! We're going to lose that whole Facility!"
E02_M01_090_010="[{i Stenson}]: Thank goodness you've made it! Repair the Core, quickly!"
E02_M01_140_010="[{i Arnold}]: Looks like you got all the patrols. You actually impressed me with that one, rookie."
E02_M01_150_010="[{i EarthCom}]: Station Lima Foxtrot come in. I repeat, Station Lima Foxtrot come in. It's no good. I think we lost them. Abort mission and recall. EarthCom out."
E02_M01_160_010="[{i EarthCom}]: The Core has been repaired and the Station is secure. Good job, Lieutenant. EarthCom out."

E02_M03_030_010="[{i Nakamura}]: Lieutenant, this is Constable Nakamura of Luthien. We'll be ready to evacuate once you get some escorts down here. They're going to hit us hard, so you'll need some tanks and Mobile Anti-Air units. Make sure they're escorted by Gunships. Luthien out."

MP_Taunt_0023="I underestimated you. I won't do so again."
MP_Taunt_0024="The Illuminate is coming for you, Imperial."
MP_Taunt_0025="Are you afraid, Imperial? You should be."
MP_Taunt_0026="The tyranny of the UEF will not stand."
MP_Taunt_0027="Your Commander Suit will make a fine funeral pyre."
MP_Taunt_0028="The Aeon will purge the galaxy of those who seek to destroy humanity."
MP_Taunt_0029="It is not too late to accept The Way."
MP_Taunt_0030="The UEF murdered my family. I will have my revenge."
MP_Taunt_0031="You are no match for the power of righteousness."
MP_Taunt_0032="It is time to die."
MP_Taunt_0033="I serve the Princess. Your schemes will be exposed."
MP_Taunt_0034="You are an affront to humanity."
MP_Taunt_0035="When we are through, the Cybrans will be extinct."
MP_Taunt_0036="The flames of our righteousness are cleansing the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0037="You were dead the moment you put that chip in your head."
MP_Taunt_0038="There will be no mercy for you."
MP_Taunt_0039="None will mourn you, Cybran."
MP_Taunt_0040="We Cybran are advancing along all fronts! You cannot stop us!"
MP_Taunt_0041="All we want is our freedom. Why is that so hard for you to understand?"
MP_Taunt_0042="I will enjoy watching you die."
MP_Taunt_0043="The UEF is nothing more than a tyrant in disguise."
MP_Taunt_0044="Grrrrrr."
MP_Taunt_0045="This is far from over."
MP_Taunt_0046="Your actions here are immoral."
MP_Taunt_0047="You will perish on this day."
MP_Taunt_0048="I see the Aeon have decided to join in the fun."
MP_Taunt_0049="Once that gun is down, the UEF will cease to exist."
MP_Taunt_0050="Your empire is crumbling."
MP_Taunt_0051="You can't stop us."
MP_Taunt_0052="The fires of freedom burn throughout the galaxy. You will now reap what you have sown."
MP_Taunt_0053="You will pay for attacking Dr. Brackman."
MP_Taunt_0054="This is much too easy."
MP_Taunt_0055="You are finished."
MP_Taunt_0056="I have seen The Way. Everything you believe is a lie."
MP_Taunt_0057="Soon the Aeon will have purged the non-believers from the galaxy. There will be peace."
MP_Taunt_0058="You're gonna have to do better than that, Captain."
MP_Taunt_0059="The Aeon Illuminate is the truth."
MP_Taunt_0060="Your fate is sealed."
MP_Taunt_0061="Marxon will cleanse the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0062="General Clarke has betrayed you. She is nothing more than a warmonger and liar."
MP_Taunt_0063="It is time to end this."
MP_Taunt_0064="Black Sun will kill millions of innocents. Can you live with that blood on your hands?"
MP_Taunt_0065="You will never defeat the Aeon Illuminate."
MP_Taunt_0066="The Avatar-of-War has seen your defeat."
MP_Taunt_0067="Every soul on Earth shall be cleansed by my hand."
MP_Taunt_0068="Your lies and secrets have been exposed for all to see."
MP_Taunt_0069="Surrender now, and I shall offer you a merciful death."
MP_Taunt_0070="Impressive."
MP_Taunt_0071="Why do you continue to struggle?"
MP_Taunt_0072="There is no stopping the Aeon."
MP_Taunt_0073="Once the UEF falls, the Cybrans are next."
MP_Taunt_0074="You are an abomination."
MP_Taunt_0075="The UEF will never fire that weapon."
MP_Taunt_0076="I will exterminate the Cybrans myself."
MP_Taunt_0077="The Avatar-of-War demands Earth be cleansed."
MP_Taunt_0078="Earth is ours!"
MP_Taunt_0079="You will soon be extinct."
MP_Taunt_0080="The end is finally at hand. "
MP_Taunt_0081="No one can stop us!"
MP_Taunt_0082="The Earth will burn."
MP_Taunt_0083="Soon Black Sun will be ours."
MP_Taunt_0084="In a matter of hours, all Cybrans will be free."
MP_Taunt_0085="The UEF will never enslave anyone again."
MP_Taunt_0086="It's only a matter of time now."
MP_Taunt_0087="Once we control Black Sun, no one will ever threaten the Cybrans again."
MP_Taunt_0088="You dare to set foot on Orionis?"
MP_Taunt_0089="You will never stop us!"
MP_Taunt_0090="I will not rest until you are destroyed."
MP_Taunt_0091="Cybrans are a blight that must be cleansed."
MP_Taunt_0092="I am guided by The Way."
MP_Taunt_0093="Your presence here defiles this holy place."
MP_Taunt_0094="You cannot defeat me!"
MP_Taunt_0095="Your days are at an end."
MP_Taunt_0096="You're nothing more than a crazed terrorist."
MP_Taunt_0097="It is time to pay for your crimes against humanity."
MP_Taunt_0098="You and your kind sicken me."
MP_Taunt_0099="You will die on this day."
MP_Taunt_0100="There is no stopping us. We will restore the Empire."
MP_Taunt_0101="I think you underestimate me."
MP_Taunt_0102="You cannot defeat me!"
MP_Taunt_0103="The UEF will bring order to the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0104="You were a fool to come here, Cybran."
MP_Taunt_0105="I have the might of the UEF behind me!"
MP_Taunt_0106="Dr. Brackman is a crazy old bastard. You follow a fool."
MP_Taunt_0107="There is more here than meets the eye."
MP_Taunt_0108="Soon all the enemies of the UEF will be destroyed."
MP_Taunt_0109="A Cybran who actually stands and fights?"
MP_Taunt_0110="And here I thought all Cybrans were cowards."
MP_Taunt_0111="You won’t leave Pollux alive, Cybran."
MP_Taunt_0112="The UEF will finally end the Infinite War!"
MP_Taunt_0113="I have the might of the UEF behind me!"
MP_Taunt_0114="I will defend this facility with my life!"
MP_Taunt_0115="Black Sun will destroy you and every other madman."
MP_Taunt_0116="This island shall be your tomb."
MP_Taunt_0117="The UEF will triumph!"
MP_Taunt_0118="There is no chance of surrender. This is a fight to the end."
MP_Taunt_0119="The UEF will unite the galaxy...no matter the cost."
MP_Taunt_0120="Your madness will be your undoing."
MP_Taunt_0121="I will never bow to the Aeon!"
MP_Taunt_0122="I will not rest until every Symbiont is free from your terror."
MP_Taunt_0123="This planet is under my protection. You will never take it."
MP_Taunt_0124="My AI is always calculating your next move."
MP_Taunt_0125="The civilians here are under my protection."
MP_Taunt_0126="This is not a fight you can win."
MP_Taunt_0127="I will parade your remains through the streets."
MP_Taunt_0128="Procyon will be your tomb."
MP_Taunt_0129="We will never bow down to your madness."
MP_Taunt_0130="Your fanaticism is destroying the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0131="Today you die."
MP_Taunt_0132="Grrrrrr."
MP_Taunt_0133="The Way is nothing more than a fairy tale."
MP_Taunt_0134="There is nothing here for you except death."
MP_Taunt_0135="We will be free!"
MP_Taunt_0136="You will never conquer Matar."
MP_Taunt_0137="The UEF will never surrender to the Aeon."
MP_Taunt_0138="You are a fanatic."
MP_Taunt_0139="The end game is approaching. You will lose."
MP_Taunt_0140="The UEF will save the galaxy from you fanatics."
MP_Taunt_0141="I will restore order to the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0142="You're not winning this fight."
MP_Taunt_0143="I'm going to add your head to my trophy case."
MP_Taunt_0144="Today the Infinite War comes to an end. "
MP_Taunt_0145="Black Sun will be ours!"
MP_Taunt_0146="You will never harm another Cybran."
MP_Taunt_0147="Once the Gates go down, the Aeon Illuminate is finished."
MP_Taunt_0148="The UEF has oppressed us for too long!"
MP_Taunt_0149="Your 'Way' is no match for Cybran technology."
MP_Taunt_0150="You will never defeat me."
MP_Taunt_0151="Soon all Symbionts will be free."
MP_Taunt_0152="The Avatar will bring peace to the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0153="The UEF is close to defeat. Join us so that we can defeat them together!"
MP_Taunt_0154="The Princess is soft and weak. She knows nothing of waging war."
MP_Taunt_0155="It saddens me to think of killing a fellow Aeon, but I will if I must."
MP_Taunt_0156="The Avatar has promised glorious rewards to those that follow him."
MP_Taunt_0157="The Avatar is the reason the UEF army is on the run."
MP_Taunt_0158="Only Avatar Marxon can protect us from the fury of Black Sun."
MP_Taunt_0159="You should be fighting beside me, not against me!"
MP_Taunt_0160="The UEF is unstoppable!"
MP_Taunt_0161="I will not let you cleanse this planet."
MP_Taunt_0162="The Aeon army is comprised of murderers and madmen."
MP_Taunt_0163="So this is the mighty Aeon Illuminate. I'm unimpressed."
MP_Taunt_0164="I think you underestimate me."
MP_Taunt_0165="I will never surrender to you."
MP_Taunt_0166="The UEF will restore order to the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0167="Mark my words, Black Sun will fire!"
MP_Taunt_0168="Your fanaticism will not protect you."
MP_Taunt_0169="The Aeon have splintered. You are weak."
MP_Taunt_0170="I will defend Black Sun with my life."
MP_Taunt_0171="On this day, the Aeon will be destroyed."
MP_Taunt_0173="Surrender is your only option!"
MP_Taunt_0174="Earth will not fall to the likes of you!"
MP_Taunt_0175="You'll pay for killing Colonel Arnold!"
MP_Taunt_0176="The UEF will never stop waging war against the Aeon."
MP_Taunt_0177="Vengeance will be mine!"
MP_Taunt_0178="I will never stop hunting you, Aeon!"
MP_Taunt_0179="You abandoned your humanity a long time ago."
MP_Taunt_0180="Soon the Aeon will be extinct."
MP_Taunt_0181="You will answer for your crimes!"
MP_Taunt_0182="I will not allow you to escape!"
MP_Taunt_0183="The Princess is no match for me. And neither are you."
MP_Taunt_0184="Toth begged before she died. She was a coward to the very end."
MP_Taunt_0185="Once I've taken Earth, the Princess will fall by my hand. She will not escape me a second time."
MP_Taunt_0186="This is your last chance to join me."
MP_Taunt_0187="The Way is a weapon. It must be wielded as such."
MP_Taunt_0188="I will rule the galaxy."
MP_Taunt_0189="The Seraphim meant for us to lead humanity."
MP_Taunt_0190="With the power of Black Sun, I will conquer the galaxy!"

SCMP_001_Description="Initial scans of the planet revealed evenly spaced hills, leading some to believe that the hills were ancient alien burial mounds. Subsequent scans disproved this theory, but many believe that the old Earth Empire actually found alien remains, spirited them away and then faked the scans as part of the cover-up."
SCMP_002_Description="Not technically a lake, but rather an upwelling of gases that have combined to form a 'water-like' liquid. Most of the gases are unknown and all three factions are eager to exploit the area and discover its secrets."
SCMP_003_Description="Named after a long-dead Imperial officer, Drake was sent in to quell a secessionist movement and found himself facing an organized army. He was forced to retreat to the opposite ridge of the ravine, and it was at that position he was able to get enough units online to fight back. Drake defeated the secessionists and the ravine has since borne his name."
SCMP_004_Description="Underwater for millennia, tectonic shifts have drained the Crater, exposing the Mass needed to continue the Infinite War. Sparse forests have sprung up in the intervening years, though they are often destroyed in the continuous fighting that rages in the Crater."
SCMP_005_Description="Once a haven for smugglers, the islands were named after the 'gentlemen' that did business there. Now the islands host a different kind of gentleman, Commanders from the three factions who vie with each other for control of the planet."
SCMP_006_Description="Named for an early explorer, Ian's Cross has witnessed countless battles. The relatively open area and plentiful Mass deposits have encouraged continual battles for several years."
SCMP_007_Description="A small strip of green surrounded by ice and snow, no one is really sure who first called this area Open Palms. Legend has it that originally this was neutral ground, where soldiers of any faction could come without fear of attack. Hence, all who came had 'open palms,' meaning no weapons were carried."
SCMP_008_Description="For years, these glaciers had been mined by the Aeon, who gave them their name. However, with the ebb and flow of battle, the Aeon have been driven off and the glaciers will belong to whomever can hold them."
SCMP_009_Description="Dozens of battles have been fought over the years across Seton's Clutch. A patient searcher could find the remains of thousands of units resting beneath the earth and under the waves."
SCMP_010_Description="A warlord called Sung once called this island home. He chose it for both its great beauty and abundant resources. Sung has long since been driven off, but the resources remain for whoever can take them."
SCMP_011_Description="Once a small continent, the UEF constructed a research base here for advanced weapons testing. The researchers lost control of an experimental weapon and the resulting explosion decimated the continent, ripping it into a few scattered islands. Now all three factions are attempting to find evidence of this weapon for their own purposes."
SCMP_012_Description="In the early days of the settlement, wayfarers knew to go through the arch and head due north to reach civilization. These days, the Passage is much more dangerous, thanks to the constant fighting that moves back and forth across the desert."
SCMP_013_Description="Sometimes two Commanders need a private place to conduct a private fight. Winter's Duel is the arena of choice when the battle has become personal."
SCMP_014_Description="Old mariner's tales speak of the Bermuda Triangle, where ships would disappear without a trace. The Bermuda Locket has much the same reputation, save that it's Commanders who never return."
SCMP_015_Description="With almost no water and little vegetation, there is very little reason to come to the Fields. However, it does possess abundant Mass , which makes it a natural place for Commanders to fight."
SCMP_016_Description="Canis River is known for two things. The first is the river, which is home to mineral deposits, especially gold. The second is that it's ideal for a one-on-one fight."
SCMP_017_Description="This place is unremarkable in every respect. However, it does sit on a major Gate hub, offering easy access to a good portion of the galaxy. For this reason alone, many Commanders have fought to the death to claim this place."
SCMP_018_Description="When this region was originally settled, towers were placed on the hill to keep watch over the area. It became known as Sentry Point, a name it has kept long after the people who named it had gone."
SCMP_019_Description="Many years ago, a Commander called Finn was defeated and forced to flee. He later drew his opponent to a small island and defeated him. The island has held his name ever since."
SCMP_020_Description="An unnatural, sunken area of an otherwise normal ocean, many believe the Abyss was created by aliens for some unknown purpose. Though disproved by scientific surveys, the mere rumor of possible alien technology is enough for all three factions to fight savagely for control of the area."
SCMP_021_Description="Flagged 'hazard' by the old Earth Empire, Alpha 7 has been quarantined for hundreds of years. Only now have the factions begun to wonder why. Did it contain aliens, some sort of plague or virus? No one knows, but the factions are willing to fight to find out."
SCMP_022_Description="The only hospitable spot on an otherwise desolate ice planet, the Refuge is unremarkable, save that if a Gate could be built there, it would make an excellent staging area for further operations."
SCMP_023_Description="Often the fight for a world comes down to a single battle. All the maneuvering, strategy and preparation culminate in one final brawl. Victory at Varga Pass means victory over an entire planet."
SCMP_024_Description="No one knows how the shape of this particular land mass was created. Many theories have been proposed, but the answer will probably never be known."
SCMP_025_Description="The only viable land located in a vast sea, the Colony has seen more than its fair share of war. Now deserted, Commanders still come to determine who can claim Saltrock Colony."
SCMP_026_Description="Vya-3 was once a haven from war. The clouds of red dust choked intake vents and shorted circuit boards, stopping even the mightiest army in its tracks. New technology, however, allows units to operate in this unforgiving environment, and now battle has returned to the red plains."
SCMP_027_Description="Surrounded by lava, the Scar is little more than an outcropping of rock that hasn't yet been consumed by the fire around it. Despite its dangerous environment, it does possess significant mineral deposits, which draw Commanders from all over to battle for its riches."
SCMP_028_Description="Once the home of exclusive resorts and expensive spas, the Oasis was the playground of the rich and connected. Yachts plied the water and presidents could be seen mingling with business tycoons. The Aeon eventually found the Oasis and destroyed the resorts, building temples in their places. Now, many years later, the Infinite War has come again to the Oasis."
SCMP_029_Description="Classified"
SCMP_030_Description="Originally a staging ground for UEF naval unit testing, the planet was overrun by the Aeon many years ago. Now it lies in contested territory and Commanders from all over come to try and claim it."
SCMP_031_Description="The Cybrans thought they were lucky to find such a pristine, resource-rich area to build a new settlement. The Aeon, however, quickly appeared, followed closely by the UEF. Now the settlement will be lucky to survive the ravages of the Infinite War."
SCMP_032_Description="In a different age, the Wilderness might have been a nature preserve. With its waterways and thick forests, life of all kinds flourished. The Wilderness, though, had the misfortune to be chosen as a Gate hub. Its forests now echo with the crash of weapons fire and the waterways are clogged with the hulls of broken warships."
SCMP_033_Description="White Fire was a secret Aeon naval base. The Aeon built hundreds of ships and then unleashed them upon their unsuspecting enemies. They almost took the planet, but the UEF rallied, struck back and eventually White Fire was destroyed. Now, years later, the war has returned to the area and everyone is determined to claim the base for themselves."
SCMP_034_Description="The gunslingers are long gone, but Commanders looking for a showdown know they'll find one at High Noon."
SCMP_035_Description="The first explorers to find this place thought they had found paradise. The warm water, cool breezes and miles of beaches were a welcome respite in a harsh galaxy. Word spread and soon everyone wanted a little piece of Paradise. "
SCMP_036_Description="The mining colony at Blasted Rock had hoped that they could find riches beneath the sand. However, word soon spread about the rich mineral deposits and now the colony has to fight just to survive."
SCMP_037_Description="The thick, brackish water clings to everything, staining anything it touches. If it weren't for this planet's proximity to the Quarantine Zone, no one would ever bother coming here."
SCMP_038_Description="Bandits used to lurk in the area, watching the road that wound between the hills. The bandits are long since gone, but the Pass is still a favorite spot for a fight."
SCMP_039_Description="A former UEF naval testing ground, the UEF used to set up targets on land and bombard them with a variety of vessels. The facilities have long since been abandoned, but the wealth of data and ruined units has drawn Commanders from each faction."
SCMP_040_Description="Devoid of any atmosphere, vegetation or animal life, the Ditch is the last place anyone would want to go. However, it does have amazingly rich mineral deposits, which makes it worth fighting for."

TU01_TUB050_010_001="Welcome to the Archiva Videographa. Through use of this interface, you can find and access the knowledge and information accumulated by generations of your predecessors. You can return to the Archiva Videographa at any time by pressing the large Tutorial Icon (?) that appears on your screen. You can end the video you have been playing by clicking the left mouse button. There are numerous categories of tutorials, so be sure to review all of them."
TU01_TUB100_001_001="You can zoom in or out on your Armored Command Unit's (ACU) visual interface using your mouse wheel; your viewpoint will zoom in under the cursor. You can also move your visual viewpoint using your cursor keys. View the selection from the Archiva for more information."
TU01_TUB100_001_002="Your Armored Command Unit's, or ACU, visual interface allows you to see the entire Theater of War. By scrolling your mouse wheel on your Heads-Up Display (HUD), you can zoom in on any part of the map; the display zooms in under your cursor. You can also zoom out to see the entire Theater of War."
TU01_TUB100_001_003="When zoomed out, the visual appearance of units and buildings will change to Strategic Icons. You can still select units and buildings and give them any orders you can give them while zoomed in. This is a significant strategic advantage that you should use to full effect."
TU01_TUB100_001_004="When zoomed in, you can move your HUD visual window in many ways, including with the arrow keys: left, right, up and down. Your relative viewpoint on the Theater of War is displayed via the indicator box in the Mini Map."
TU01_TUB200_001_001="The Command Interface in your ACU uses left-click to select units and right-click to order those units into action. You can drag-select groups of units or double-click a unit to select all units of that type. Play the recording from the Archiva Videographa to learn more."
TU01_TUB200_001_020="The Command Interface mouse buttons are used to select your units and order them to carry out various actions. Your left mouse button is used to select one or more units. Your right mouse button is used to order selected units and factories into action."
TU01_TUB200_001_030="To select a single unit or factory, point to the unit in your HUD and left-click. To select a group of units, hold down the left mouse button and \"draw\" a box around the desired units; the HUD will then report the number and type of units you have selected. To select all units of a certain type within your view window, double-click one of the units. Note that double-clicking a unit when zoomed all the way out selects all of the units of that type in the Theater of War.\n"
TU01_TUB200_001_040="Once you have selected units or factories, right-click to issue orders. The orders you can give depend on the unit and the situation. The easiest example is a basic move order: select a unit and then right-click the destination for that unit."
TU01_TUB200_001_050="The orders you give depend on the context of the unit and situation. If you select a unit and then right-click on a friendly unit, the default order will be the Guard command. The default right-click action on a hostile unit would be the Attack command."
TU01_TUB200_001_055="Engineers have different abilities; their default right-click actions will differ from other units. The style of the cursor indicates the action that will be taken on a right-click and corresponds to the Command Interface area of your HUD."
TU01_TUB200_001_060="All actions that a unit or group of units can take is also available through your Command Interface. Left-click a unit, then left-click the desired command, and finally left-click the destination location or destination object within the HUD view."
TU01_TUB200_001_070="Remember what you learned at the Academy: left-click selection, right-click action!"
TU01_TUB300_010_010="Your initial build sequence will often dictate the course of your game. You must balance the need for material resources with the need to create offensive, defensive, engineering units and structures. For examples and more data, view the Archiva Videographa."
TU01_TUB300_010_020="Your early build orders should balance the need to gather resources with the need to create units, factories and base defenses. The location of Mass Extraction Areas is marked in your HUD by a box with a green X inside of it."
TU01_TUB300_010_030="A good early build strategy is the following: build two to three Mass Extractors; two to three Power Generators; then build your first factory, such as a Land Factory. From there, you can continue to build up your resource infrastructure with your ACU's superior build speed, or with Engineers that you produce from your factories."
TU01_TUB300_010_040="As you build up the offensive capability, and defensive structure, of your base, it is a good idea to always be mindful of resources. Engineers should constantly be building the most advanced Energy and Mass production structures available to you.\n"
TU01_TUB350_010_010="You can order an Engineer or your ACU to construct several factories (or other buildings) in a row by holding down the Shift key while giving construction orders. To review these techniques, refer to the Archiva Videographa."
TU01_TUB350_010_020="To create a queue of build commands for your ACU, or any other engineering units, hold down the Shift key while using build commands. In this example, we have ordered the ACU to build three Mass Extractors, followed by three Power Generators and an Aircraft Factory. As the orders are issued, the list of structures to be built is displayed in your HUD."
TU01_TUB350_010_030="You can review the build orders and build locations of any Engineer or your ACU by selecting that unit and holding down the Shift key; you can also see where the units will be placed by pressing the Shift key. It is possible to remove units from the build queue. In this example, we'll remove one of the Power Generators that is scheduled to be built before the Air Factory. Now the Air Factory will be constructed sooner."
TU01_TUB350_010_040="You can quick build many of the same structures by using your Shift key and dragging your mouse across the HUD. For example, you can quickly issue wall building orders, or quickly order several Power Generators to be built in a row."
TU01_TUB400_001_005="The Unit Command Interface in your Heads-Up Display (HUD) shows the available commands for the units(s) currently selected. View the Archiva for more detailed information."
TU01_TUB400_001_010="Almost all units within the Theater of War, including factories, have orders that can be issued through the Unit Command Interface. This tank shows the five basic orders that most units share:  Move, Attack, Patrol, Stop and Assist. You issue orders via the Unit Command Interface by left-clicking the unit, the order and the destination or target of the order. You can issue orders by right-clicking in most situations, as well."
TU01_TUB400_001_020="Select an Engineer, and you will see several other commands; the Attack command is not visible since Engineers cannot attack. The four Engineer-related commands are Reclaim, Capture, Repair and Pause. Engineers can reclaim natural resources such as trees and mineral formations and can capture enemy units or structures. They can also repair damaged units, including themselves, and pause while they are building a structure or a queue of structures. More on Pause momentarily."
TU01_TUB400_001_030="Specialty and advanced units may have other Unit Commands available to them. Your ACU is a good example; the Commander has a full upgrade system available as well as the Overcharge attack capability. Understanding these unit commands is a key to victory!"
TU01_TUB400_001_040="Each of the Unit Commands has a keystroke shortcut that will save you time, such as A for the Attack command. Remember also that most commands can be issued to a unit or group of units through the right-click interface: The command cursor shows you the command that will be issued if you right-click."
TU01_TUB425_010_010="The Unit Command Interface in your Heads-Up Display (HUD) shows the available commands for the units(s) currently selected. This entry covers advanced unit commands. View the Archiva for more detailed information."
TU01_TUB425_010_020="Let's examine the basic commands. The Move and Attack commands are self-explanatory. To issue a Patrol command, click the Patrol command icon and the location to which the unit should patrol. To issue a multi-point patrol command--for example, to patrol the perimeter of your base--hold down the Shift key while setting patrol points. An Engineer will repair units and reclaim resources that it finds on its patrol route."
TU01_TUB425_010_030="The Stop command will order your units to stop and clear any queued commands. The Stop command also clears the build queue of an Engineer or a factory. This can be helpful when your tactical situation calls for a quick change in build strategies."
TU01_TUB425_010_040="The Assist command is very helpful. When one Engineer is ordered to assist another, it will essentially double the building power of the assisted Engineers. There is no limit on how many Engineers you can order to assist. An Assist command given to a combat unit is equivalent to a Guard command."
TU01_TUB425_010_045="For example, ordering an air defense unit to assist your ACU will provide you with air protection. Remember that the Shift key works in combination with all commands to form a string or queue of commands. For example, if you want a combat unit to avoid enemy defenses while moving to a specific location, hold the Shift key while issuing multiple move commands."
TU01_TUB425_010_060="Many units feature the Pause button. This is particularly important for Engineers, factories and any unit that requires a lot of Energy to operate or fire. For example, by pausing this factory, its build orders are put on \"hold\", and it stops consuming Energy. You resume building by pressing Pause again. You can pause all factories by selecting them and then pressing Pause."
TU01_TUB450_010_010="The Build Options Interface area of your HUD displays the units that are currently available. The top section of the display shows you what can be built; the bottom shows the Build Queue for the selected Engineer or factory. View the Archiva Videographa for complete information on this interface."
TU01_TUB450_010_020="The Unit Build Options interface area of your HUD is activated when you select your Commander suit, any Engineer, a Factory, or an upgradeable building or unit. It has two major visual interface areas: showing you your Build Options on top, and any Build Queue at the bottom. First, let's examine how to order units from a Tech 1 factory."
TU01_TUB450_010_030="To construct a unit, click on the appropriate factory and then left-click on the unit icon to begin construction. Shift-click will order five of those units to be built, while alt-click will order 500. As you order units to be built, they are added to the Unit Build Queue at the bottom. If you have alternate unit build orders, the queue will reflect those orders."
TU01_TUB450_010_035="You can add units in the queue by left-clicking on the appropriate unit icon in the Build Queue. Similarly, you can remove units from the Build Queue by right-clicking on the  icon in the queue. You can stop all building and remove all units from the queue with the Stop command."
TU01_TUB450_010_040="Building structures with your ACU or Engineer works in a similar fashion, but you must designate where the structure should be built. Press Shift to build multiple buildings. You can remove structures from your ACU or Engineer's Build Queue, but you can only add structures to the Build Queue by using the Shift key; this will add the new structure at the end of the Build Queue."
TU01_TUB450_010_050="Engineers and factories each have four levels: Tech 1; Tech 2; Tech 3; and a fourth \"specialty\" or experimental level. Here we have a Tech 1, 2 and 3 Factory, and a Tech 1, 2 and 3 Engineer. By default, the unit build options that are displayed reflect the tech level of the specific Engineer or factory, but it is important to note that a Tech 3 Engineer or factory can also produce Tech 1 and 2 units."
TU01_TUB450_010_055="You access the different tech levels using the selection icons at the left side of the Build Options Interface. Your Build Queue can contain items from any tech level. A Tech 3 engineer can also access the Specialty build section just below the Tech 3 icon."
TU01_TUB450_010_060="Your ACU has a specialty build menu of its own, which is covered in more detail in other archival entries."
TU01_TUB500_010_010="Your ACU's Heads-Up Display (HUD) contains key visual feedback elements that are designed to assist you in battle: the Main Strategic and Tactical view area; the Unit Command Interface; the Build Options and Build Queue; the Mini Map; Economic and Objective Indicators; and more. View the selection from the Archiva for more data."
TU01_TUB500_010_020="Let's review the key elements of your ACU's Heads-Up Display (HUD). The main tactical and strategic view area occupies the center of your HUD. Depending on your viewpoint, this view area provides either a tactical view of units within a sector or a strategic view of the Theater of War."
TU01_TUB500_010_030="The Unit Command Interface provides a visual display of all commands for a selected unit or group of units. If you select an Engineer, a factory or your ACU, the Build Options Interface and Build Queue display will become active.   "
TU01_TUB500_010_040="The Mini Map has the same function as your main display: zoom in or zoom out also works in the Mini Map. The area your main view screen is currently centered on is highlighted by the red box in the Mini Map. You can switch between various special military, economic, Intel and other view highlights using the controls around the Mini Map."
TU01_TUB500_010_050="At the top of your HUD, you'll find economic indicators that give you the production and consumption status of your two primary resources: Energy and Mass. These indicators have various display options for you to choose between. At the top-center of your screen are additional Command Options for communication, diplomacy and other important options."
TU01_TUB500_010_055="On the right side of your main HUD view area are locator icons for your Commander, available Engineers and other important units. Right-click the icons to locate and navigate to those units."
TU01_TUB600_010_001="Your Land, Air and Naval Factories give you access to both offensive and defensive combat units; each unit provides unique strategic and tactical advantages. The Archiva will provide you with examples of these unit types."
TU01_TUB600_010_002="Each of your three types of factories, Land, Air and Naval, produce units of varied types and provide you with the combination of offensive and defensive capabilities you need to execute your strategies. Each technology level of the factories adds more firepower to your arsenal.\n"
TU01_TUB600_010_003="Tech 1 land units include a Light Scout Vehicle, Mobile Artillery, anti-air, Fast Attack Bots and Medium Tanks. Scout your enemy early and often with the fast and agile scout vehicle. It is a good idea to create anti-air early to prevent losses from enemy bombers. The balance of the combat units at Tech 1 provide excellent offensive and defense against other land-based units.\n"
TU01_TUB600_010_040="At Tech 2, considerable firepower is made available to you. The Mobile Missile Launcher and Heavy Tank are both effective at range against any land-based unit or structure. The Amphibious Tank can travel across both water and land to strike your enemy from unexpected quarters."
TU01_TUB600_010_045="The Mobile Anti-Air Flak Artillery is key to base defense against advanced air units, and will also provide air cover for your expeditionary force. Finally, the Mobile Shield Generator is a unique defensive unit for your base and front-line forces."
TU01_TUB600_010_050="At Tech 3, two incredibly powerful units are introduced: The Siege Bot and the Mobile Artillery. These are two of the most powerful conventional units available to you. The Siege Bot is fast-moving and capable of firing powerful missiles on the move at any land-based unit or structure. It is a Commander killer. While not as mobile, the Artillery unit can strike at your enemy from long-range and delivers a devastating blow."
TU01_TUB700_010_001="Air Factories produce air units that offer both offensive and defensive capabilities. View the Archiva to find out more."
TU01_TUB700_010_002="The Tech 1 air units immediately available from your Air Factory provide you with power capabilities in your struggle. They are the Light Air Scout, the Interceptor, the Attack Bomber and the Light Transport.  \n"
TU01_TUB700_010_003="Like its land counterpart, the Air Scout is fast and maneuverable and features an extended sight range. It has obvious advantages for scouting over any type of terrain. The Interceptor provides excellent base defense against bombers, especially when set to patrol your base perimeter. It has air-to-air combat capability."
TU01_TUB700_010_004="The Attack Bomber is an effective and potentially devastating offensive weapon. You can catch your opponent napping early in the conflict if no base air defenses have been created.  Bombers are also very effective against attack forces, especially those with no anti-air units in the convoy.\n"
TU01_TUB700_010_005="Air Transports give you the ability to quickly move combat units, Engineers and your ACU to a crucial battle, construction zone or out of danger. They're also equipped with air-to-ground weaponry, and can be devastating gunships when loaded with combat units, which fire from the transport's sides.\n"
TU01_TUB700_010_006="Tech 2 air adds a higher capacity transport, a Torpedo Bomber for attacking any unit in the water and a Gunship. Gunships are powerful air-to-ground attack weapons, and one of the most destructive units available."
TU01_TUB700_010_007="At Tech 3 you can order the Spy Plane and far more powerful versions of the T1 units: The Air Superiority Fighter; Strategic Bomber; and the Heavy Gunship. The Spy Plane is a hyperspeed version of the Air Scout, and  features extremely long-angle vision.   \n\n"
TU01_TUB800_010_001="Naval Factories support your war effort by offering a wide variety of combat capabilities across three technology levels. View the Archiva to augment your training in this area."
TU01_TUB800_010_020="Like the Land and Air Factories, your Naval Factory creates Tech 1, 2 and 3 units with a wide variety of capabilities. At the Tech 1 level, your Naval Factory can construct the Frigate and the Submarine. The Frigate is a fast and flexible naval unit with both ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore weaponry, as well as anti-air capability."
TU01_TUB800_010_025="It is ideal for mobile defense of your capital ships, your naval base and the seaward approaches to your land bases. The Tech 1 submarine can hunt any naval target, including floating and sub-surface structures."
TU01_TUB800_010_030="At the Tech 2 level, your Naval Factory produces powerful additions to your fleet. The Destroyer packs significant ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore firepower and offers excellent anti-sub capability if backed up with sonar. The Cruiser has both a powerful howitzer-type gun for ship and shore capability and sea-launched medium-range missiles."
TU01_TUB800_010_040="At the Tech 3 level, you can produce naval units that will be difficult for your opponent to counter. The Battleship is a floating island of death and features long-range howitzers, multiple anti-air weapon banks, side-mounted torpedo launchers and more. The Strategic Missile Submarine lets you unleash a sea-launched nuclear strike against any target in the Theater of War."
TU02_TUE200_001_001="The Assist capability lets you quickly build important structures and create a high-output factory. To learn how this capability works, review the Archiva."
TU02_TUE200_001_020="The Assist command is particularly important with your Engineers. To create a high-output level of combat units, the more Engineers you have assisting your factories and other Engineers, the better. A simple assist example is one Engineer assisting another. This Engineer has several structures in its Build Queue, as we can see by selecting it and holding down Shift."
TU02_TUE200_001_025="By ordering another Engineer to assist, the Build Queue will be completed sooner. The more Engineers you have assisting, the faster construction will be complete. By holding down Shift, you can see which Engineers are assisting the first Engineer. Chaining large numbers of Engineers to a single Engineer with a build route is an excellent strategic technique."
TU02_TUE200_001_030="In this example, we have a factory with a long Build Queue of combat units needed for the front lines. By issuing the Assist command, those units will be created much faster. If the Assist command is issued to many nearby Engineers, the production rate of the factory can be increased many times over. Your ACU provides the greatest level of build assist."
TU02_TUE200_001_040="A unit that is upgrading, such as this Tech 1 Mass Extractor, can also be assisted by an Engineer and your ACU. All Engineer commands can also be issued to your ACU.  "
TU02_TUE200_001_060="The higher an Engineer is up the tech tree, the higher their building capability. (A Tech 3 Engineer will offer more assistance than a Tech 1 Engineer, for example.) As your economy grows, it will not be unusual for you to assist factories with numerous Tech 2 and Tech 3 Engineers, and have large groups of assist Engineers constructing Energy and Mass structures."
TU02_TUE200_001_070="Remember that Engineers building or assisting consume Energy and Mass; if your economy is in the red, you can pause or stop Engineers to reduce demand."
TU03_TUF200_010_001="Factories create both Engineers and combat units. When unit building is complete, your factory can automatically deploy those units via the regular unit commands. Review the Archiva to learn more about the available commands."
TU03_TUF200_010_002="Your Land, Air and Naval Factories produce Engineers and various combat units. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, your factories are capable of automatically deploying those units in several different ways. In order to do this, you'll use standard commands from your Unit Orders interface. "
TU03_TUF200_010_003="You can see the current deployment orders of a factory by selecting the factory and pressing the Shift key. By default, the unit will move from the factory to a rally point close by and to the south of the factory. To change the rally point, simply select the factory and right-click the desired rally location. You can also click and drag the current rally location to any desired rally point.   "
TU03_TUF200_010_004="You can order deployed units to automatically patrol by holding down Shift and issuing patrol commands. In this example, all produced air fighters will patrol the perimeter of the base upon deployment. You can also order units to automatically assist another unit upon deployment. In this case, manufactured Engineers will automatically assist the ACU.  "
TU03_TUF200_010_005="Factories can be \"chained\" to the same build orders as other factories by using the Assist command. This factory has a perpetual build order of several different unit types. To set this factory to use the same build orders, we use the assist command: left-click the new factory, then right-click the target factory. We can chain any number of factories together in this fashion for effortless mass production of units."
TU03_TUF300_001_001="Land, Air and Naval Factories can be upgraded from Tech 1 to Tech 3. The ACU's unique build-ahead capabilities let you queue upgrades and any level of unit. The Archiva has more information."
TU03_TUF300_001_002="Your Land, Air and Naval Factories are capable of upgrading from Tech 1 to Tech 3. In order to upgrade a factory, select the Upgrade icon from a completed or in process factory. The Upgrade icon will usually appear as the last item on the unit build list."
TU03_TUF300_001_003="In addition to the ability to upgrade your unit types, your factories can take orders for units before the upgrades or the initial build of the factory is even complete. In this example, we'll start constructing a Land Factory. We select the in-process factory and begin to order units from it. We can also order an upgrade to the next tech level. Once this has been done, the next tech-level units are available to be constructed as well."
TU03_TUF300_001_004="In this final example, we'll build a Tech 1 Air Factory, immediately order an upgrade, further order a second upgrade to Tech 3 and begin construction on five Tech 3 Engineers and five Tech 3 Siege Bots. Remember that pre-ordering units will impact your economy as those upgrades and unit orders are filled by the factory."
TU04_TUC100_010_001="To be successful on the battlefield, you must have a steady and growing economy. Mastery of the production of Energy and Mass are important keys to victory. Study the recommended techniques via the Archiva."
TU04_TUC100_010_020="The building blocks of your war machine are Energy and Mass. Without a steady and growing supply of both, your efforts against your opponents will be greatly hampered. You can gain Energy by creating Power Generators at Tech 1, 2 and 3.  You can also gain Energy by harvesting the natural resources of the planet with your Engineers or ACU."
TU04_TUC100_010_025="Harvesting Energy can be very important in the beginning stages of your campaign. Building Power Generators directly next to factories and certain other structures gives you an adjacency bonus and a small boost in production. Take advantage of this where you can."
TU04_TUC100_010_030="You can collect Mass from the planet's core by extracting it at Mass Extraction Points, which are highlighted on your HUD. Your ACU and Engineers can also reclaim mineral resources on the planet's surface. Finally, you can also create Mass Fabricators  at the Tech 1 and Tech 3 levels. Be aware that Mass Fabricators require Energy to operate."
TU04_TUC100_010_040="Once you have gated to a new Theater of Battle, it is a good idea to construct two to three Mass Extractors with your ACU, followed by two to three Tech 1 Power Generators before starting construction of a factory."
TU04_TUC100_010_045="Once your factory is complete, Engineers should be constructed, and at least some of your Engineers should be assigned to Energy and Mass creation activities on a constant basis: creation of Power Generators and Mass Extractors and Fabricators. In the early stages of building your base and forces, it can also be beneficial to use some Engineers to patrol areas rich with natural resources in an effort to bolster your early economy.\n"
TU04_TUC100_010_050="Mass and Energy storage units expand the capacity of your economy and reduce the loss of surplus production. Constructing storage while your production is in a positive state can help you when your production begins to ramp up and you are producing less Energy and Mass than you are consuming. As long as you still have Energy and Mass in storage, your factories and Engineers can operate at full speed."
TU04_TUC200_010_001="After you've gated in and created your basic economy, continue to build a solid base of Energy and Mass production. The Archiva provides additional information."
TU04_TUC200_010_020="There are many strategies that a Commander can employ on the battlefield. Many of them are quick, decisive strikes against the enemy that do not necessarily require a large Energy and Mass production base. In a prolonged engagement, you'll need to steadily build up your economy. "
TU04_TUC200_010_025="The Tech 1 techniques of building up your early Energy and Mass production have been discussed; as you proceed through the tech tree to Tech 2, it is wise to continue building up your resources with the Tech 2 Power Generators and to upgrade your Mass Extractors to Tech 2 and even Tech 3 levels. It is important that you not upgrade your Mass Extractors all at once. A good technique is to have your Engineers assist the Mass Extractors as they upgrade."
TU04_TUC200_010_030="At Tech 1, it can be a good strategy to assign groups of Engineers to continually build new Power Generators and Mass Extractors and Fabricators. If you build up a large number of Fabricators, be prepared to pause some or all of them if your Energy production stalls."
TU04_TUC200_010_035="Double-clicking on a Mass Fabricator in the strategic zoom view is a fast way to pause all Fabricators. A good technique for creating Engineer gangs to build up Energy is to order one Engineer to build, and then order several others to assist the first."
TU04_TUC200_010_050="A solid economy is built by continually upgrading your Mass and Energy production. At the Tech 2, this means building Tech 2 Power Generators and steadily upgrading your Mass Extractors to Tech 2 and Tech 3 levels. Mass Fabricators can be used to balance out Energy and Mass production."
TU04_TUC250_010_001="Stalled economies have doomed many rookie Commanders. Find out how to avoid this (and what to do if it happens) by visiting the Archiva."
TU04_TUC250_010_020="It is important to avoid stalling your economy at all stages of the conflict, but particularly in the critical beginning phases. Early economy stalls are often caused by failing to create an initial combination of Mass extraction and Energy production before building factories or other structures."
TU04_TUC250_010_025="Over construction with too many Engineers before Energy and Mass infrastructure have been built up is another common cause. Attempting to simultaneously upgrade several Mass Extractors is to be avoided."
TU04_TUC250_010_030="You'll know your economy is stalling when your Mass or Energy HUD interface shows red, or you receive warning messages and/or when your capacity bars are low or zero. If your overall build efficiency drops below 50%, this is another quick indicator. There are several steps you can take to get your economy back on track. If you are over-building, you can pause some of your Engineers."
TU04_TUC250_010_035=" In this example, we're over-building so we'll pause some Engineers and move others from the factory project to the Energy project and the Mass upgrade project. In this example, we've killed our economy by upgrading three Mass Extractors at the same time; we'll pause the upgrade on two of them."
TU04_TUC250_010_040="In this case, our Mass production is fine but our Energy is critical--a good time to pause production on any operating Mass Fabricators. We can un-pause the Fabricators when our Energy gets back on track."
TU04_TUC250_010_045="Another strategy is to pause factories. Here we have a healthy Tech 1 war machine of six factories, but we're over-producing, so we'll pause production on some of the factories to focus more resources on building our economic infrastructure. Remember to un-pause units that you've paused to get back on track once your economy is booming again."
TU04_TUC300_010_001="In the later stages of a long campaign, you'll need to deploy advanced Energy- and Mass-producing structures. Visit the Archiva for more information."
TU04_TUC300_010_002="Your war machine will require ever-increasing amounts of Energy and Mass if you wish to deploy Tech 3, Experimental and Strategic weaponry.  As you did at the Tech 2 level, it will be important to continue to build your infrastructure with Tech 3 Energy production facilities. It will be important also to create groups of Tech 3 Engineers, which have the fastest building speed of any Engineers, and order them to create a queue that builds up your Energy infrastructure."
TU04_TUC300_010_003="At this stage of your struggle against the enemy, it also becomes important to protect your infrastructure with shielding, counter-nuke measures and other defenses. Also in these later stages, battlefield reclamation can be a great source of Mass.   Finally, you must be ready at the Tech 3 level to manage your resources by pausing the Energy-draining advanced Mass Fabricators, as well as other large units that may be draining Energy. At this stage, the economic overlay can be a great aid."
TU05_TUA100_010_001="Tech 1 transport systems let you execute many strategies that are crucial achieving success on many types of planetary terrain. The Archiva provides the information you need to gain an understanding of transport operations."
TU05_TUA100_010_020="Your Tech 1 Air Factory can produce a light transport craft capable of transporting Engineers, combat units and even your Commander to any land point in the Theater of War. Tech 1 transports have six sets of transport hooks, three on a side, that can load up to six units depending on unit mass and size. While Tech 1 transports are lightly armored and have no on-board weaponry, the combat units you load can fire from the side, making your transport a powerful gunship."
TU05_TUA100_010_030="Transports are constructed at your Air Factories. There are several ways to load a transport: You can select a single unit or a group of units and point at the transport to be loaded on your HUD; when the \"load\" cursor appears, right-click."
TU05_TUA100_010_035="If the units are close to the transport, they will move into position and mag-load to the transport clamps. If the transport is out of range, the transport will move to your units and load. If you have more units than will fit on a single transport and have multiple transports available, select the units to load and use Shift with the load command on each transport. All units will load."
TU05_TUA100_010_040="To unload a transport, select the transport, then the Transport command from the Unit Commands menu, and left-click on the destination. You can use the Shift key to lay in a multi-point move route before putting in the final transport command. This allows you to avoid detection or defenses as you move your units. If you're using your transports as gunships, simply order them into battle using the Move or Patrol commands. Patrolling a loaded transport around an enemy base will cause a lot of destruction."
TU05_TUA200_010_001="Ferry routes between two points automatically keep units flowing from one point to the other. Review the Archiva to learn more about this important technique."
TU05_TUA200_010_020="Using your transports, you can you can set an automatic ferry route between two points. This lets you continually move units between those points. To set up a ferry route, place your transport at the Origin point. Select the Ferry command from the Unit Commands menu, then select the Destination point. "
TU05_TUA200_010_025="The transport will automatically lay down a Ferry Beacon. If the transport was already loaded with units, it will begin its first run. If not, it will wait and load units at the Ferry Beacon and then begin its run."
TU05_TUA200_010_030="To get units to the ferry route, it is important to note that you must load the units to the Ferry Beacon, not to the transport itself. A Load command to the transport will override the Ferry command and the Beacon will be destroyed. In this example, we're selecting a large group of units to move to the Ferry Beacon. The transport will continue to move them all to the destination point."
TU05_TUA200_010_050="You can automatically load units to a ferry point directly from a factory. To do so, simply select the factory, then right-click the Ferry Beacon when the load cursor appears. If several factories are feeding a Ferry Beacon, you can easily send a full load of units with each transport. The ferry system can keep your units flowing smoothly to the front lines."
TU05_TUA400_010_001="Shields provide powerful protection for bases and other key strategic areas. Learn how to effectively deploy them, and manage their Energy consumption, by viewing the Archiva."
TU05_TUA400_010_020="At the Tech 2 and Tech 3 level, you can construct shield generators to protect your base, your ACU or any other units or positions you wish to fortify. The difference between the Tech 2 and Tech 3 generators is their protective area, defense power and Energy consumption rate. A shield will protect units within its protective perimeter from fire OUTSIDE that perimeter only; it provides no protection once ground forces penetrate the shield."
TU05_TUA400_010_025="For that reason, an effective strategy for base protection is to create multiple overlapping shields. If one is penetrated or goes down, your key units are still protected. In this example, the ACU is under the protection of three overlapping shields."
TU05_TUA400_010_030="Shields consume a lot of Energy. When you begin to construct shields, you must also ensure a continuing and growing supply of Energy generation. If your Energy dips below 100% or goes into the negative, your shields will be less effective and they will flicker on and off. "
TU05_TUA400_010_035="In this case, use the Pause capability of your shield generators to turn off less critical shields in favor of the most critical. You should construct new Power Generators on a 1:1 ratio with shields: For each Tech 2 shield you need a Tech 2 Power Generator; for each Tech 3 shield you need a new Tech 3 Power Generator. It is also important to remember that shields do not protect you from nuclear attack."
TU05_TUA500_010_001="Scouting and intel are the most important counter-strategy weapons in your arsenal. In order to effectively combat the enemy, you must know their activities. Learn about basic intel tools via the Archiva."
TU05_TUA500_010_020="Your most basic intelligence gathering units are your Land and Air Scouts, which are fast units with an extended sight range. Constant scouting with these units is one of your best intelligence-gathering tools."
TU05_TUA500_010_025="At the Tech 1 level, your Engineers can also begin to erect radar stations on land and sonar stations at sea to help you locate enemy units. Many Commanders deploy radar across the Theater of War; Tech 1 radar towers are inexpensive to deploy. For the sea battle, sonar is essential for targeting submarines."
TU05_TUA500_010_030="At the Tech 2 level, you can deploy long-range radar: It's similar to Tech 1 radar, but offers a far greater range. It is important to note that Tech 1 and Tech 2 radar can be fooled or jammed by stealth counter-radar units. At the Tech 2 level, you can begin to construct stealth stations to jam and counter enemy radar."
TU05_TUA500_010_035="Stealth towers cover a certain protective area, and consume Energy. Particularly important for forward secret bases, you should rely on stealth technology in your intelligence war. Note that stealth can be countered by the advanced Omni radar systems that will be discussed later."

Any assignment in violation of this Agreement is void, except that you may transfer your Software to another person provided that person accepts the terms of this License Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such decision shall not affect the enforceability of: (i) such provision under other circumstances, or (ii) the remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances.

SCMP_001_Description="Initial scans of the planet revealed evenly spaced hills, leading some to believe that the hills were ancient alien burial mounds. Subsequent scans disproved this theory, but many believe that the old Earth Empire actually found alien remains, spirited them away and then faked the scans as part of the cover-up."
SCMP_002_Description="Not technically a lake, but rather an upwelling of gases that have combined to form a 'water-like' liquid. Most of the gases are unknown and all three factions are eager to exploit the area and discover its secrets."
SCMP_003_Description="Named after a long-dead Imperial officer, Drake was sent in to quell a secessionist movement and found himself facing an organized army. He was forced to retreat to the opposite ridge of the ravine, and it was at that position he was able to get enough units online to fight back. Drake defeated the secessionists and the ravine has since borne his name."
SCMP_004_Description="Underwater for millennia, tectonic shifts have drained the Crater, exposing the Mass needed to continue the Infinite War. Sparse forests have sprung up in the intervening years, though they are often destroyed in the continuous fighting that rages in the Crater."
SCMP_005_Description="Once a haven for smugglers, the islands were named after the 'gentlemen' that did business there. Now the islands host a different kind of gentleman, Commanders from the three factions who vie with each other for control of the planet."
SCMP_006_Description="Named for an early explorer, Ian's Cross has witnessed countless battles. The relatively open area and plentiful Mass deposits have encouraged continual battles for several years."
SCMP_007_Description="A small strip of green surrounded by ice and snow, no one is really sure who first called this area Open Palms. Legend has it that originally this was neutral ground, where soldiers of any faction could come without fear of attack. Hence, all who came had 'open palms,' meaning no weapons were carried."
SCMP_008_Description="For years, these glaciers had been mined by the Aeon, who gave them their name. However, with the ebb and flow of battle, the Aeon have been driven off and the glaciers will belong to whomever can hold them."
SCMP_009_Description="Dozens of battles have been fought over the years across Seton's Clutch. A patient searcher could find the remains of thousands of units resting beneath the earth and under the waves."
SCMP_010_Description="A warlord called Sung once called this island home. He chose it for both its great beauty and abundant resources. Sung has long since been driven off, but the resources remain for whoever can take them."
SCMP_011_Description="Once a small continent, the UEF constructed a research base here for advanced weapons testing. The researchers lost control of an experimental weapon and the resulting explosion decimated the continent, ripping it into a few scattered islands. Now all three factions are attempting to find evidence of this weapon for their own purposes."
SCMP_012_Description="In the early days of the settlement, wayfarers knew to go through the arch and head due north to reach civilization. These days, the Passage is much more dangerous, thanks to the constant fighting that moves back and forth across the desert."
SCMP_013_Description="Sometimes two Commanders need a private place to conduct a private fight. Winter Duel is the arena of choice when the battle has become personal."
SCMP_014_Description="Old mariner's tales speak of the Bermuda Triangle, where ships would disappear without a trace. The Bermuda Locket has much the same reputation, save that it's Commanders who never return."
SCMP_015_Description="With almost no water and little vegetation, there is very little reason to come to the Fields. However, it does possess abundant Mass , which makes it a natural place for Commanders to fight."
SCMP_016_Description="Canis River is known for two things. The first is the river, which is home to mineral deposits, especially gold. The second is that it's ideal for a one-on-one fight."
SCMP_017_Description="This place is unremarkable in every respect. However, it does sit on a major Gate hub, offering easy access to a good portion of the galaxy. For this reason alone, many Commanders have fought to the death to claim this place."
SCMP_018_Description="When this region was originally settled, towers were placed on the hill to keep watch over the area. It became known as Sentry Point, a name it has kept long after the people who named it had gone."
SCMP_019_Description="Many years ago, a Commander called Finn was defeated and forced to flee. He later drew his opponent to a small island and defeated him. The island has held his name ever since."
SCMP_020_Description="An unnatural, sunken area of an otherwise normal ocean, many believe the Abyss was created by aliens for some unknown purpose. Though disproved by scientific surveys, the mere rumor of possible alien technology is enough for all three factions to fight savagely for control of the area."
SCMP_021_Description="Flagged 'hazard' by the old Earth Empire, Alpha 7 has been quarantined for hundreds of years. Only now have the factions begun to wonder why. Did it contain aliens, some sort of plague or virus? No one knows, but the factions are willing to fight to find out."
SCMP_022_Description="The only hospitable spot on an otherwise desolate ice planet, the Refuge is unremarkable, save that if a Gate could be built there, it would make an excellent staging area for further operations."
SCMP_023_Description="Often the fight for a world comes down to a single battle. All the maneuvering, strategy and preparation culminate in one final brawl. Victory at Varga Pass means victory over an entire planet."
SCMP_024_Description="No one knows how the shape of this particular land mass was created. Many theories have been proposed, but the answer will probably never be known."
SCMP_025_Description="The only viable land located in a vast sea, the Colony has seen more than its fair share of war. Now deserted, Commanders still come to determine who can claim Saltrock Colony."
SCMP_026_Description="Vya-3 was once a haven from war. The clouds of red dust choked intake vents and shorted circuit boards, stopping even the mightiest army in its tracks. New technology, however, allows units to operate in this unforgiving environment, and now battle has returned to the red plains."
SCMP_027_Description="Surrounded by lava, the Scar is little more than an outcropping of rock that hasn't yet been consumed by the fire around it. Despite its dangerous environment, it does possess significant mineral deposits, which draw Commanders from all over to battle for its riches."
SCMP_028_Description="Once the home of exclusive resorts and expensive spas, the Oasis was the playground of the rich and connected. Yachts plied the water and presidents could be seen mingling with business tycoons. The Aeon eventually found the Oasis and destroyed the resorts, building temples in their places. Now, many years later, the Infinite War has come again to the Oasis."
SCMP_029_Description="Classified"
SCMP_030_Description="Originally a staging ground for UEF naval unit testing, the planet was overrun by the Aeon many years ago. Now it lies in contested territory and Commanders from all over come to try and claim it."
SCMP_031_Description="The Cybrans thought they were lucky to find such a pristine, resource-rich area to build a new settlement. The Aeon, however, quickly appeared, followed closely by the UEF. Now the settlement will be lucky to survive the ravages of the Infinite War."
SCMP_032_Description="In a different age, the Wilderness might have been a nature preserve. With its waterways and thick forests, life of all kinds flourished. The Wilderness, though, had the misfortune to be chosen as a Gate hub. Its forests now echo with the crash of weapons fire and the waterways are clogged with the hulls of broken warships."
SCMP_033_Description="White Fire was a secret Aeon naval base. The Aeon built hundreds of ships and then unleashed them upon their unsuspecting enemies. They almost took the planet, but the UEF rallied, struck back and eventually White Fire was destroyed. Now, years later, the war has returned to the area and everyone is determined to claim the base for themselves."
SCMP_034_Description="The gunslingers are long gone, but Commanders looking for a showdown know they'll find one at High Noon."
SCMP_035_Description="The first explorers to find this place thought they had found paradise. The warm water, cool breezes and miles of beaches were a welcome respite in a harsh galaxy. Word spread and soon everyone wanted a little piece of Paradise. "
SCMP_036_Description="The mining colony at Blasted Rock had hoped that they could find riches beneath the sand. However, word soon spread about the rich mineral deposits and now the colony has to fight just to survive."
SCMP_037_Description="The thick, brackish water clings to everything, staining anything it touches. If it weren't for this planet's proximity to the Quarantine Zone, no one would ever bother coming here."

X01_M01_106_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Make yourself useful and destroy those bases."
X01_M01_110_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I'm starting to think that you don't have the stomach to fight your own kind. Are you going to destroy those bases or what?"
X01_M01_116_010="[{i Fletcher}]: We're going to lose Fort Clarke unless you get on with it. Destroy those bases!"
X01_M01_117_010="[{i Hall}]: Commander, it is imperative that you move inland as quickly as possible. Countless lives hang in the balance."

X01_M02_012_010="[{i Hall}]: Change in plans, Commander. Fletcher's going to have to hold Fort Clarke a bit longer on his own -- you will defend the civilians and eradicate any enemy forces in the area."

X01_M02_039_010="[{i Graham}]: The civilians are safe. I am forever in your in debt, Commander."
X01_M02_040_010="[{i Graham}]: Oh no ... they've wiped out the entire town. All those civilians ... dead."
X01_M02_041_020="[{i Graham}]: Another problem, Colonel. There's a second town east of your position. The Order commander hasn't attacked them yet, but it can only be a matter of time. Please protect it."
X01_M02_042_010="[{i Hall}]: I want those civilians out of there, Colonel. Constable Graham is making a group of trucks available to you; use them to evacuate the civilians to the city center."
X01_M02_042_020="[{i HQ}]: You need to tell those trucks where you want them to move. Click on the Command Signal button on your HUD, below the Objective Reminder, then click the ground where the trucks should go. HQ out."
X01_M02_043_010="[{i Graham}]: The shelters are safe for now, Colonel, but I don't think they can survive another attack. If the Order commander was to come at us again..."
X01_M02_044_010="[{i Gari}]: My scans show a group of trucks coming online. Full of civilians, no doubt. I shall take great pleasure in hunting them."
X01_M02_045_010="[{i HQ}]: Enemy naval units coming into range, Colonel. Sink them before they can bombard the city. HQ out."
X01_M02_046_010="[{i Graham}]: I don't believe it ... the entire town has been lost."
X01_M02_047_010="[{i HQ}]: Enemy naval units coming into range, Colonel. Sink them before they can attack. HQ out."
X01_M02_050_010="[{i Hall}]: There's a truck in the open, Colonel. Get it moving."
X01_M02_060_010="[{i Graham}]: Commander, we need to get those trucks to safety!"
X01_M02_070_010="[{i Graham}]: The trucks are exposed, Colonel!"

X01_M02_160_010="[{i Graham}]: The civilians are dead ... there is no one left..."
X01_M02_161_010="[{i Gari}]: Ha-ha-ha!"
X01_M02_170_010="[{i Graham}]: A truck has reached the city center, sir."
X01_M02_180_010="[{i Graham}]: A second truck is safe."
X01_M02_190_010="[{i Graham}]: All the trucks have arrived, and we're getting the civilians to safety. I can never thank you enough, Colonel."
X01_M02_200_010="[{i Graham}]: Too many trucks were destroyed ... it's over..."
X01_M02_210_010="[{i Hall}]: Good work, Colonel. I'm damn proud to have you in the UEF."
X01_M02_240_010="[{i HQ}]: Your backside ain't out of the fire yet, Commander. Scans show Order units massing for a counter-attack from the northeast. HQ out."
X01_M02_240_020="[{i HQ}]: The Order commander has launched her attack. It's going to be ugly. HQ out"
X01_M02_245_010="[{i HQ}]: The Order commander is moving sniper bots into position. They're quick and pack a punch, but their armor isn't worth a damn. HQ out."
X01_M02_250_010="[{i Gari}]: At long last, the end of the UEF is within my sights. This day has been a long time coming."
X01_M02_250_020="[{i Hall}]: We'll fight you to the very end."
X01_M02_260_010="[{i Gari}]: When I am done here, I will seek out and destroy your beloved Dr. Brackman. And there will be no one left to stop me."
X01_M02_260_020="[{i Dostya}]: We'll fight you to our last breath."
X01_M02_270_010="[{i Gari}]: You have abandoned your people, your heritage and your gods. For that, you will be destroyed."
X01_M02_270_020="[{i Rhiza}]: You have perverted The Way with your fanaticism. For that, you will be destroyed."
X01_M02_280_010="[{i HQ}]: The counter-attack has been routed. HQ out."
X01_M02_281_010="[{i HQ}]: Got a Galactic Colossus heading your way. Deal with it. HQ out."
X01_M02_290_010="[{i Hall}]: That Order commander has caused us enough grief -- assault her position and take her out."
X01_M02_290_020="[{i HQ}]: You heard the man, Commander. Move inland and engage Gari."
X01_M02_290_030="[{i HQ}]: One other thing: I'm receiving distress alerts from several small towns that fall in your path. Help them if you're able, but eradicating Gari is your top priority."
X01_M02_320_010="[{i HQ}]: That sure was a pretty sight. Maybe the next Order commander won't be so eager to flap her jaw. HQ out."
X01_M02_330_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Kael will rage when she learns of this! Glory to the Princess! Rhiza out."
X01_M02_340_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like Gari is sending out the welcome wagon.   "

X01_M02_360_010="[{i HQ}]: Protect that town, Commander! HQ out."
X01_M02_370_010="[{i HQ}]: You need to get those trucks to safety, Commander. HQ out."

X01_M02_390_010="[{i Dostya}]: Time is of the essence, Commander. You must destroy the Order commander. Dostya out."
X01_M02_400_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Gari has shamed us all. Destroy her. Rhiza out."
X01_M02_410_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like that alien is launching a nuke. Flight trajectory indicates it's heading toward the town to the east. HQ out."

X01_M03_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Get your wired ass up here and help defend the Fort!"
X01_M03_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Help me defend the Fort, Cybran!"
X01_M03_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Quit messin' around and get some reinforcements up here! The Fort is taking serious damage!"
X01_M03_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Fort Clarke is under heavy attack! I need units up here pronto!"

X01_M03_090_010="[{i Fletcher}]: This is Brigadier Fletcher requesting assistance! Seraphim forces are pounding me pretty hard!"
X01_M03_100_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Where are my reinforcements?"
X01_M03_120_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That alien freak is due east of my location. Assault its position from the south, and I'll push in from the west. It won't be able to defend two fronts at once."
X01_M03_122_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That alien freak is due east of my location. Its got some experimental units stomping around, and we'll need to destroy those, too. Assault its position from the south, and I'll push in from the west. It won't be able to defend two fronts at once."
X01_M03_130_010="[{i Fletcher}]: You gonna sit around or are you gonna get your hands dirty? The Seraphim's to my east. Attack it."
X01_M03_130_020="[{i Dostya}]: Defeat the Seraphim, Commander. Show this fool how Cybrans fight. Dostya out."

X01_T01_003_010="[{i Gari}]: An experimental? I am not so foolish as to let you finish that."
X01_T01_010_010="[{i Gari}]: You will never reach Fort Clarke."
X01_T01_020_010="[{i Gari}]: I continue to press closer to your beloved Fort Clarke. Soon it will burn."

X01_T01_040_010="[{i Gari}]: Your tenacity is admirable, but the outcome of this battle was determined long ago."
X01_T01_050_010="[{i Gari}]: You may have stopped me, but you have no hope of defeating the Seraphim."
X01_T01_060_010="[{i Gari}]: Now you will taste the fury of the Order of the Illuminate."

X02_DB01_010_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Commander, I wanted to personally thank you for aiding my beloved Loyalists. They are our first line of defense against the Order of the Illuminate's treachery and losing them would have been a devastating blow. The coming days will be dark, but don't lose heart. Our ultimate victory is closer than you think."

X02_M01_020_010="[{i Thalia}]: Hmpf, I didn't expect Rhiza to send a UEF commander. Celene's forces are attacking my base. Deal with them. Thalia out."

X02_M01_045_010="[{i Thalia}]: I managed to steal the schematic for the Order Sprite Striker. It is yours. Use it to bring glory to the Princess."

X02_M01_070_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Celene, you once swore an oath to the Princess, yet you serve her enemies. Does your word mean so little?"

X02_M01_151_010="[{i HQ}]: Maybe those Loyalists aren't worthless. Those power generators are what's keeping the shields operable at Celene's primary base. Take out the generators, and the shields are toast. HQ out."

X02_M02_012_010="[{i HQ}]: From there, things will probably go from bad to worse. We have to assume the enemy has defensive fortifications on the far side of the pass."

X02_M02_130_010="[{i Mathea}]: Rhys is still free, Champion. Mathea out."
X02_M02_140_010="[{i Mathea}]: The Loyalists need Rhys' information, Champion. Mathea out."
X02_M02_150_010="[{i Mathea}]: The defenses are down, and we are moving on Rhys' location. Thank you for your assistance; he will soon be telling us everything he knows ... whether he wants to or not. Mathea out."
X02_M02_160_010="[{i QAI}]: It is time to end this. My primary attack force is moving into position."

X02_M02_170_010="[{i Princess}]: Hear me, people of the Illuminate! I am Princess Rhianne Burke, rightful leader of the Aeon. The Seraphim are not the saviors they claim to be. They bring nothing save death and destruction!"

X02_M03_017_020="[{i Brackman}]: This is a perfect opportunity for us, my child. Oh yes. I have been working on a translator, a device that will let us decode what the Seraphim are saying to each other."
X02_M03_017_030="[{i Brackman}]: If you capture the Quantum Gate that the Seraphim will use, I will upload a program that will kill the pilot as it exits the Gate. Oh yes. The Seraphim ACU will be yours to command, and I will be able to decipher its language matrix."
X02_M03_017_040="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim is coming in via a Gate located near QAI's base. Capture that Gate. HQ out."
X02_M03_020_010="[{i Brackman}]: Capture the Gate, my child. Capture it."
X02_M03_021_010="[{i Brackman}]: Once you have destroyed QAI's ACU, Loyalist forces will arrive and secure the Seraphim commander. Oh yes. Then I will be able to decipher its language matrix."

X02_M03_030_010="[{i Brackman}]: Excellent work, my child, excellent work. Now that the Gate is under your control, summon the Seraphim commander. Oh yes."
X02_M03_030_020="[{i HQ}]: You heard the talking brain. Bring in the Seraphim ACU. HQ out."
X02_M03_040_010="[{i Brackman}]: Please summon the Seraphim ACU, Commander."
X02_M03_050_010="[{i Brackman}]: We're running out of time, out of time. You must summon the Seraphim ACU before our scheme is uncovered."
X02_M03_060_010="[{i Brackman}]: Excellent! Simply move the Seraphim ACU back to your base. Oh yes. Once it is safe, we will take care of the rest."
X02_M03_070_010="[{i Brackman}]: QAI is attempting to destroy the Seraphim ACU, my child. You must not allow that to happen."
X02_M03_080_010="[{i Brackman}]: Protect the Seraphim ACU, Commander. Oh yes."
X02_M03_090_010="[{i Brackman}]: I cannot complete my work on the translator until you deliver the ACU, Commander."
X02_M03_100_010="[{i Brackman}]: I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Seraphim ACU, my child."
X02_M03_110_010="[{i Brackman}]: Ah, there we are. Nicely done, my child, nicely done. Thank you."
X02_M03_120_010="[{i HQ}]: QAI's got a Cybran ACU in its base. Dunno if it's piloted or if it's simply being controlled by QAI. Regardless, you need to destroy it. HQ out."
X02_M03_120_020="[{i QAI}]: The betrayal by Celene was not within expected parameters. However, the situation has been re-evaluated and my victory is still the most probable outcome of this conflict."
X02_M03_120_030="[{i Celene}]: I was wrong to have sided with you, monster. I shall atone for my actions by destroying you."
X02_M03_130_010="[{i Celene}]: Commander, I offer you one of the Order's best kept secrets, the Quantum resource generator. It offers a nearly endless supply of Mass and Energy."
X02_M03_140_010="[{i Celene}]: Sister, I have a CZAR with a full complement of air units at the ready. Click on the Command Signal button and then click on a target. I will direct it to annihilate your target."
X02_M03_190_010="[{i Celene}]: Keep up the pressure!"
X02_M03_200_010="[{i Celene}]: Where are your boasts now, machine?"
X02_M03_210_010="[{i Celene}]: The glory of the Princess now guides my actions. Your days on this planet are drawing to a close."
X02_M03_215_010="[{i Celene}]: I've taken too much damage! I'm sorry, Commander, but I must recall."
X02_M03_220_010="[{i HQ}]: Destroy QAI, Commander. HQ out."
X02_M03_230_010="[{i HQ}]: My bladder is the size of a melon, Commander. If you don't hurry up and destroy QAI, I'm going to have an accident here in the control room. HQ out."
X02_M03_240_010="[{i Hall}]: Looks like something big is going down in Illuminate space. Sensors are registering numerous nuclear detonations and several Quantum Wakes. No idea what's happening, but it's a safe bet that it's tied to Burke reappearing. Hall out."
X02_M03_250_010="[{i Celene}]: Please forgive me, Rhiza. I was wrong to reject the Princess."
X02_M03_250_020="[{i Rhiza}]: You will have ample opportunity to atone for your actions. But be warned -- should you stray again, I will destroy you myself."
X02_M03_260_010="[{i Dostya}]: The tracking bug is ready to deploy. Move any Engineer to the designated position within QAI's base, and the Engineer will upload the tracking bug. Dostya out."

X02_M03_280_010="[{i Dostya}]: A word of warning, Commander. QAI is protecting its shores with a new torpedo system. Because it is constructed on the seafloor, the only way to destroy it is with torpedoes. Dostya out."
X02_M03_285_010="[{i Dostya}]: The Engineer has reached its destination and the program has been deployed. The program has tagged QAI's ACU -- attack and destroy it. Dostya out."
X02_M03_290_010="[{i Dostya}]: The Engineer has been lost, Commander. You will need to deliver another one to the Loyalists and have the program reinstalled. Dostya out."
X02_M03_300_010="[{i Dostya}]: The Engineer has reached its destination and the program has been deployed; it is now spreading throughout QAI's systems. It's tagged QAI's ACU -- attack and destroy it. Dostya out."
X02_M03_310_010="[{i Brackman}]: The Loyalists are enroute, Commander. Just a few more moments, and the Seraphim commander will be ours. Oh yes."

X02_T01_010_010="[{i Celene}]: QAI will get your friends to talk. It's only a matter of time."

X03_B01_003_020="Rhiza is already on-planet and awaits your arrival. You gate immediately. Be safe, my child. Be safe."
X03_DB01_010_010="[{i Princess}]: I must admit that I feared for my life when the Seraphim landed. They are maniacal in their desire to see me dead, but I now understand how they are to be defeated. I will meet with General Hall and Dr. Brackman to begin preparations. You will learn more when the time has come."
X03_DB01_020_010="[{i Hall}]: We're in a bad way, Gustaf. The Princess is dead, and all of the Aeon people are uniting behind Kael. They're launching attacks across the galaxy, and I don't see how we can possibly win. We only have a couple of options, and none of them are pretty."
X03_DB01_030_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander, do you read me ... Commander?"
X03_M01_010_010="[{i HQ}]: This is going to be a hell of a fight, Commander. Link up with Rhiza and get Burke out of there. HQ out."
X03_M01_020_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Colonel, before we can launch our primary offensive, we must destroy a Seraphim naval base located to your north."
X03_M01_021_010="[{i Rhiza}]: This will secure our flank and allow us to push east."
X03_M01_022_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Prepare your forces. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_030_010="[{i Rhiza}]: A Cybran coming to the aid of the Princess? Your first task is to destroy the Seraphim naval base to the north. "
X03_M01_031_010="[{i Rhiza}]: This will secure our flank and allow us to push east."
X03_M01_032_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Prepare your forces. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_040_010="[{i Rhiza}]: It is an honor to again fight by your side, Champion. Your first task is to destroy the Seraphim naval base to the north."
X03_M01_041_010="[{i Rhiza}]: This will secure our flank and allow us to push east."
X03_M01_042_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Prepare your forces. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_050_010="[{i Princess}]: I am honored that you are fighting on my behalf, but please make haste. My palace defenses will not be able to hold off the Seraphim much longer."
X03_M01_060_010="[{i Princess}]: My beloved Champion. I am ecstatic that you have arrived, but please make haste. My palace defenses will not be able to hold off the Seraphim much longer."
X03_M01_064_010="[{i HQ}]: Dammit, we're getting some weird readings from the Seraphim naval base. They're using some sort of jamming field."
X03_M01_064_020="[{i Princess}]: It is Blue Sky's crystals, Commander. Their unique structure reflects radar waves, creating an effect similar to jamming. Omni radar will quell the effect, as will destroying the crystals."
X03_M01_064_030="[{i HQ}]: You heard the lady. Either get an Omni online or blow up the crystals. HQ out."
X03_M01_066_010="[{i Dostya}]: Our technicians managed to recover one of QAI's new torpedo systems. We have christened it the HARMS and are uploading it to your ACU. Dostya out."
X03_M01_067_010="[{i HQ}]: Colonel, we got a new naval schematic for you. It's called the Bulwark and is a T2 shield mounted on a small boat. HQ out."
X03_M01_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Using a secure channel here, Colonel. Never know who else might be listening. You gotta watch your back. You really think once this is over the Aeon and Cybran are going to join hands and let us live in peace? We have to be ready for anything, even if it means kicking off another war. Fletcher out."
X03_M01_080_010="[{i Brackman}]: We are so close, my child, so close to completing work on the translator. Just a few more algorithms to decipher and it will be ready. The intelligence boon will be substantial. Oh yes."
X03_M01_090_010="[{i Rhiza}]: The fighting amongst the Aeon grows, Champion. We tread in very treacherous waters; Kael still controls the military and is purging anyone suspected of Loyalist leanings. Be on your guard."
X03_M01_100_010="[{i Kael}]: You're going to die here, Burke. And then I shall deal with your so-called Loyalists."
X03_M01_100_020="[{i Princess}]: My people reject you, Kael, turn their back on your hatred and lies. It's only a matter of time now."
X03_M01_101_010="[{i HQ}]: Picking up increased activity on the island to your north. Dunno what that alien is up to, but it's building something big. Keep your eyes open. HQ out."
X03_M01_102_010="[{i Rhiza}]: The island is ours, Commander. We can now begin our assault on the base. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_150_010="[{i HQ}]: Scratch one naval base. HQ out."
X03_M01_200_010="[{i Rhiza}]: We must destroy the naval base. Every moment we tarry places the Princess in greater danger!"
X03_M01_210_010="[{i Rhiza}]: The Princess is in danger! We must destroy the base quickly!"
X03_M01_220_010="[{i Rhiza}]: My forces are sweeping and clearing the areas you have already attacked. Any remaining enemy units or structures will be destroyed. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_230_010="[{i Rhiza}]: I have ordered my forces to deal with any enemies that remain in your operational area. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_OBJ_010_010="Destroy the Seraphim Naval Base"
X03_M01_OBJ_010_020="Secure the local waterway by destroying the marked Seraphim structures."
X03_M01_OBJ_010_030="The Eye of Rhianne"
X03_M01_OBJ_010_035="Scry through the fog of war to temporarily counter the jamming crystals."
X03_M01_OBJ_010_040="Escort the Loyalists"
X03_M01_OBJ_010_045="Signal the Loyalist refugees to move to the targeted location."
X03_M01_OBJ_010_050="Call in the Loyalist Saboteur"
X03_M01_OBJ_010_055="A saboteur will stun Seraphim units in an area for a short time."
X03_M02_010_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, I am getting some strange readings from my northwest. The Seraphim commander appears to be amassing a fleet of strange units. I do not know what they are, but their size suggests that they are capable of inflicting terrible damage."
X03_M02_011_010="[{i HQ}]: Uploading a new weapon schematic, Commander. It's called the Mermaid and is a stealth boat. Only thing that can detect it is Omni. HQ out."
X03_M02_012_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, I am getting some strange readings from my southwest. The Seraphim commander appears to be amassing a fleet of strange units. I do not know what they are, but their size suggests that they are capable of inflicting terrible damage."
X03_M02_013_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like the southern base is primarily a resource base for the experimental bombers. If you can destroy the resource buildings, you'll slow down the production of the bombers. HQ out."
X03_M02_014_010="[{i HQ}]: You got 'em. Now those bombers will take twice as long to build. HQ out."
X03_M02_015_010="[{i Kael}]: I've been waiting a long time for this day, Burke. Your death will mark the closing chapter of a plan I hatched years ago."
X03_M02_015_020="[{i Princess}]: Your only plan is to sow death and destruction. You were always too foolish to look beyond your own petty desires."
X03_M02_015_030="[{i Kael}]: That is where you're wrong, Princess. This is all pre-ordained. You think Marxon was working alone when he killed your beloved Toth? Oh no. I was behind it all. From the very beginning."
X03_M02_015_040="[{i Princess}]: You lie."
X03_M02_015_050="[{i Kael}]: The Order has always wielded the true power, Princess. You were merely a formality, something to keep the chattering classes in line. But your usefulness ended years ago."
X03_M02_015_060="[{i Princess}]: I swear, Kael, I will see you answer for your crimes!"
X03_M02_015_070="[{i Kael}]: You will die a fool's death, Burke. No one will remember you, no one will call out your name. I will see to that myself."
X03_M02_016_010="[{i HQ}]: Got two enemy bases operating in your area. The one to the southeast is pretty standard fare. The one to the northeast is --"
X03_M02_017_010="[{i Princess}]: Commanders, I'm detecting some extremely alarming readings from the Seraphim base to your northeast. It's amassing a fleet of strange units, and their size suggests that they are capable of inflicting terrible damage."
X03_M02_018_010="[{i HQ}]: I got confirmation on Burke's intel. The Seraphim are building several experimental-class bombers, the same kind that blew the hell out of the Earth. If they take off, Princess Burke is in big trouble. Either destroy the bombers or the Engineers constructing them. No matter what, they can't be allowed to get in the air. HQ out."
X03_M02_019_010="[{i Rhiza}]: We must destroy those bombers!"
X03_M02_020_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Those bombers must be destroyed!"
X03_M02_021_010="[{i HQ}]: Got some intel on the Seraphim -- it's mainly using subs and AA for defense. Going to be a pain to get in there ... wait a sec..."
X03_M02_022_010="[{i HQ}]: Another new unit coming online, a T2 torpedo boat. It's got an anti-torpedo charge on it, too, so it should be able to counter those subs. HQ out."
X03_M02_023_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have received a report on the situation, Commander. We are uploading the schematic for our new T2 Barracuda. It's a dedicated sub-killer and should help you clear out those subs. Dostya out."
X03_M02_024_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, this is the Vesper, a dedicated submarine hunter. Use it against the Seraphim subs. Rhiza out."
X03_M02_025_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, I have a Quantum Optics Device that will counter the crystals and reveal an area. Because of its Energy consumption, I can only use it every few minutes."
X03_M02_025_020="[{i HQ}]: That should cut through the jamming. Click on the Command Signal button and then click on the area you want to see. We'll refresh the button as it becomes available. HQ out."
X03_M02_030_010="[{i HQ}]: One bomber destroyed. HQ out."
X03_M02_040_010="[{i HQ}]: A bomber has been destroyed. HQ out."
X03_M02_050_010="[{i HQ}]: Another one down, Commander. HQ out."
X03_M02_060_010="[{i HQ}]: If the bombers get in the air, Burke is finished. Destroy them while they're still on the ground. HQ out"
X03_M02_070_010="[{i HQ}]: Those bombers are about halfway done. Destroy them. HQ out."
X03_M02_080_010="[{i HQ}]: The bombers are nearly finished. Attack and destroy them! HQ out."
X03_M02_081_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim is prepping its attack! This is your last chance! Destroy the bombers! HQ out."
X03_M02_082_010="[{i HQ}]: Holy ... I can't believe it. You actually destroyed them."
X03_M02_090_010="[{i Princess}]: Thank you, Commander. Those bombers would have easily penetrated my defenses. All that remains now is to defeat the two Seraphim commanders."
X03_M02_100_010="[{i HQ}]: The attack is beginning, and there's nothing we can do. You failed your mission. The Princess faces certain death."
X03_M02_109_010="[{i Princess}]: I shall live on in The Way."
X03_M02_110_010="[{i Princess}]: Thank you, Commander. The Seraphim bombers would have easily penetrated my defenses. All that remains now is to defeat the two Seraphim commanders."
X03_M02_115_010="[{i Rhiza}]: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
X03_M02_115_020="[{i Kael}]: Ha-ha-ha!"
X03_M02_116_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I'm hearing all kinds of crazy stuff on this end, Colonel, and none of it is good. An Aeon civil war? Who do they think they're kidding? Those freaks will kill all of us if given the chance. This is all going to get really ugly. You just watch. Fletcher out."
X03_M02_117_010="[{i Dostya}]: Commander, the tracking bug has detected a signal being sent to QAI, and it is definitely coming from Coalition space. I am investigating the source. Dostya out."
X03_M02_120_010="[{i Princess}]: My Champion, I do not wish to distract you from the fight at hand, but I must ask a favor. My most loyal and trusted servants have taken refuge in a small temple east of my complex. Please escort them to Rhiza's position for immediate evacuation. A boat has been prepared; it will ferry them to safety."
X03_M02_120_020="[{i HQ}]: Command Signal is set for the boat, Commander. I'll refresh as needed. HQ out."
X03_M02_130_010="[{i Princess}]: The boat is yours to command, Champion."
X03_M02_140_010="[{i Princess}]: Protect them, Champion!"
X03_M02_150_010="[{i Princess}]: The boat is under attack!"
X03_M02_160_010="[{i Princess}]: Thank you, Champion. It is good to see that kindness prevails even in the midst of war."
X03_M02_170_010="[{i Princess}]: They're ... they're dead ... I shall forever mourn their loss."
X03_M02_180_010="[{i Princess}]: Please rescue my servants, Champion."
X03_M02_190_010="[{i Princess}]: The servants are ready and await your arrival, Champion."
X03_M02_200_010="[{i HQ}]: Ah hell! They made it to the Princess' base. There's no way she's going to survive."
X03_M02_210_010="[{i Princess}]: Champion, my servants will temporarily suppress the defenses in the area."
X03_M02_220_010="[{i HQ}]: We're sending over the schematic for the Neptune. It's a battlecruiser designed for ship-to-ship combat. It packs a lot of firepower, so put it to good use. HQ out."
X03_M02_230_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, you are receiving the schematic for the missile ship. It offers long-range support against defensive positions. Rhiza out."
X03_M02_240_010="[{i HQ}]: That's one bomber down. HQ out."
X03_M02_250_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like the Seraphim won't be finishing that bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_260_010="[{i HQ}]: Scratch another bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_270_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim won't be able to finish that bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_280_010="[{i HQ}]: Such a pretty explosion. HQ out."
X03_M02_290_010="[{i HQ}]: There goes another bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_300_010="[{i HQ}]: That's the last of the Seraphim bombers. HQ out."
X03_M02_310_010="[{i HQ}]: Instead of destroying the actual bombers, just destroy the Engineers constructing them. Might make your life a little easier. HQ out."
X03_M02_320_010="[{i HQ}]: Destroy the Engineers, Commander. We can't let those bombers get airborne. HQ out."
X03_M02_330_010="[{i HQ}]: I got confirmation on Burke's intel. The Seraphim is building several experimental-class bombers, the same kind that blew the hell out of the Earth. If they take off, Princess Burke is in big trouble. Either destroy the bombers or the Engineers constructing them. No matter what, they can't be allowed to get in the air. HQ out."
X03_M02_OBJ_010_010="Destroy the Experimental Bombers"
X03_M02_OBJ_010_020="Eliminate all six of the Seraphim experimental bombers before they can launch."
X03_M02_OBJ_020_010="Escort the Loyalists to Safety"
X03_M02_OBJ_020_020="If the opportunity arises, use the Command Signal to move the Loyalists to the marked area near Rhiza's base."
X03_M03_010_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim have two bases in the area, one to the north of Princess Burke's palace complex, and one to the west. Both of them are hitting her with everything they've got, so she's up against the wall. Protect Burke and destroy the Seraphim commanders. HQ out."
X03_M03_015_010="[{i Brackman}]: The translator is nearly finished. Oh yes. It will be available to you in the next operation. Well done, my child, well done. The captured Seraphim ACU was the final piece of the puzzle."
X03_M03_020_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, several of my generators have been destroyed and I need to conserve my remaining Energy for my shields. I apologize, but you must find some other way to counter the crystal jamming."
X03_M03_025_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, several of my generators have been destroyed and I need to conserve my remaining Energy for my shields. However, my technicians have prepared the Optical Device for upload; it is being sent to you as we speak."
X03_M03_050_010="[{i Princess}]: The Seraphim have launched an attack! I fear that my defenses will not hold!"
X03_M03_060_010="[{i Princess}]: The Seraphim are hitting me from all directions! I fear that my defenses will not hold!"
X03_M03_070_010="[{i HQ}]: The gloves are really coming off, Commander. The Seraphim are attacking Burke with everything they've got. Protect her. HQ out."
X03_M03_080_010="[{i HQ}]: Those attacks aren't going to stop until you've destroyed the Seraphim commanders. Erase them from the planet. HQ out."
X03_M03_090_010="[{i Princess}]: Please, Commander, you must assist me. I fear that I will not survive much longer."
X03_M03_100_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander! The Seraphim are attacking. Stop them!"
X03_M03_110_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim force has been defeated. HQ out."
X03_M03_120_010="[{i HQ}]: They ain't going to forget that butt-whipping. Good job, Commander. HQ out."
X03_M03_124_010="[{i HQ}]: Princess Burke is still in danger. You need to deal with the Seraphim."
X03_M03_125_010="[{i HQ}]: We can't get Burke out of there until the Seraphim are no longer a threat. HQ out."
X03_M03_130_010="[{i Princess}]: He is weakening, Commander!"
X03_M03_140_010="[{i Princess}]: The northern Seraphim is suffering grave losses! Keep pressing!"
X03_M03_150_010="[{i Princess}]: Hurry, Commander, the Seraphim to the north is almost defeated!"
X03_M03_160_010="[{i Princess}]: The Seraphim to the north has been defeated. Well done, Commander."
X03_M03_170_010="[{i Princess}]: The western Seraphim has lost much of his infrastructure. Do not give him time to recover!"
X03_M03_180_010="[{i Princess}]: The western Seraphim cannot sustain many more losses! Keep up your attacks!"
X03_M03_190_010="[{i Princess}]: Hurry, the western Seraphim is on the verge of defeat!"
X03_M03_200_009="[{i HQ}]: Damn, that slippery bastard gated out of here."
X03_M03_200_010="[{i Princess}]: It is no matter, we shall defeat that Seraphim commander another day."
X03_M03_200_030="[{i HQ}]: Commander, the Seraphim commander to Burke's west pulled the plug and gated out. Looks like his base is shutting down, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. HQ out."
X03_M03_201_010="[{i Princess}]: My palace is taking damage!"
X03_M03_202_010="[{i Princess}]: My palace cannot withstand much more damage!"
X03_M03_203_010="[{i Princess}]: Hurry, Commander, my defenses are weakening!"
X03_M03_204_010="[{i Princess}]: You must hurry, Commander! My defenses will soon fall!"
X03_M03_210_010="[{i Fletcher}]: The Seraphim to your south has a nuke launcher. It's lightly defended, so you shouldn't have any problem capturing it. You never know when you're going to have to nuke an alien ... or one of our so-called allies."
X03_M03_215_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Grab that launcher if you can, Colonel. Fletcher out."
X03_M03_220_010="[{i Fletcher}]: The nuke launcher is yours. Put it to use. Fletcher out."
X03_M03_230_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That was a hell of a missed opportunity, Colonel. Fletcher out."
X03_M03_235_010="[{i Rhiza}]: I'm taking too much damage -- I must recall. Commander, continue the fight without me!"
X03_M03_240_010="[{i HQ}]: To your east is the Princess' base of operations. Her palace must survive, no matter the cost."
X03_M03_250_010="[{i HQ}]: As you can see, her base has some decent defenses, but they won't survive long against a full-blown assault."
X03_M03_260_010="[{i HQ}]: This defensive line is the only thing preventing those alien bastards from launching a ground attack. I'd recommend reinforcing it."
X03_M03_270_010="[{i HQ}]: Get to it, Commander. You got a Princess to rescue. HQ out."
X03_M03_280_010="[{i HQ}]: Locking in on the two Seraphim commanders in the area. One is to the west of the Princess and one is directly to her north. Destroy them. HQ out."
X03_M03_OBJ_010_010="Defeat the Seraphim Commanders"
X03_M03_OBJ_010_020="The Seraphim are assaulting the Princess' palace. Destroy the Seraphim ACUs to save the Princess."

X04_B01_001_010="We're getting reports that two Seraphim commanders have landed on the planet Hades. My guess is that they're planning on launching a major offensive and securing Hades is the first step. We're hoping to catch them with their pants down, so you and Dostya are going to pay them a little visit."
X04_B01_002_010="For the past three years we have been unable to glean a single scrap of intel regarding the Seraphim's movements, and now we find ourselves possessing this information? It strikes me as rather convenient."
X04_B01_002_020="The intel came from a Cybran sleeper cell hidden in Seraphim-controlled space. You saying we shouldn't trust them?"
X04_B01_002_030="There are few people that I trust, especially in light of recent events. But a Cybran would never turn his back on his brothers and sisters, especially at a time like this."
X04_B01_002_040="All we know is that two Seraphim commanders have started to build Quantum Gates. Even if the intel is suspect, we can't risk letting the Seraphim complete those Gates. If they come online, they'd be able to attack any system. And we can't take that chance."
X04_B01_002_050="The OP is pretty simple: Seek out and destroy the Seraphim commanders operating on the planet. Brackman has completed his work on the Seraphim translator -- it's being uploaded into your ACU as we speak."
X04_B01_003_010="We'll provide additional intel as it becomes available. Good luck."
X04_DB01_010_010="[{i Brackman}]: My beloved Dostya is gone, cut down by one of our own. Words escape me, my child, escape me. We stand on the verge of triumph, yet those that we know and love are willing to betray us. We must deal with QAI. Oh yes. And Hex5. Some crimes are unforgivable. You know what to do."
X04_DB01_020_010="[{i Brackman}]: The Seraphim are unstoppable, oh yes. So few of us are left. So few. I shall hide, bide my time. There is no other alternative. No other choice."
X04_M01_010_010="[{i HQ}]: Both commanders are on-planet, and the OP is a go. HQ out."

X04_M01_022_010="[{i Dostya}]: I am beginning my attack. Resistance is minimal, and I am not detecting an enemy ACU. HQ, are you reading anything in the sector?"
X04_M01_022_020="[{i HQ}]: Nope. The scopes are clear. HQ out."
X04_M01_022_030="[{i Dostya}]: Keep your eyes open, HQ. I do not wish to be surprised."
X04_M01_022_040="[{i HQ}]: It's not like I got anything better to do. HQ out."
X04_M01_023_010="[{i HQ}]: Hope you're not too comfortable, Commander. You got your own problems."
X04_M01_024_010="[{i HQ}]: There's an enemy base to your west."
X04_M01_025_010="[{i Dostya}]: Commander, I have a number of Bricks on standby. Use Command Signal to control them. Dostya out."
X04_M01_026_010="[{i HQ}]: Attack and destroy it. And watch out for a counter-attack. Those aliens are sneaky bastards."
X04_M01_027_010="[{i Dostya}]: HQ, I have completed my objective and am reinforcing my position. Dostya out."
X04_M01_027_020="[{i HQ}]: Roger. HQ out."
X04_M01_028_010="[{i HQ}]: Roger. HQ out."
X04_M01_030_010="[{i Dostya}]: Complete your objective as quickly as possible, Commander. Dostya out."

X04_M01_050_020="[{i Dostya}]: I have a situation here ... the recall command is auto-failing. HQ, can you confirm? Please run diagnostics on the return Gate. HQ, please respond."
X04_M01_060_010="[{i Dostya}]: Commander, we have lost all communication with Coalition Command, and we cannot recall. Wait ... I am registering something to your west. It appears to be a jamming array -- it must what is blocking our communications. Locate and destroy the jamming device. Dostya out."

X04_M02_004_010="[{i Dostya}]: Destroy the jamming device. Dostya out."
X04_M02_010_010="[{i Dostya}]: Commander, additional jamming devices are disrupting the Quantum Field and preventing us from recalling or receiving help. Stay on target and destroy that array blocking our communication. Once it's down, HQ will be able advise on how to negate the Quantum distortions. Dostya out."
X04_M02_010_020="[{i Dostya}]: A Seraphim scout just flew over my base, so they know my position. It won't be long before they attack."
X04_M02_020_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have a visual on the device. This can't be right ... it looks like a prototype device that Dr. Brackman was creating. Destroy it. We must reach HQ. Dostya out."
X04_M02_030_010="[{i Dostya}]: Destroy the jammer! We must re-establish contact with Coalition Command!"
X04_M02_040_010="[{i Dostya}]: You must destroy the jammer! Hurry! I fear the Seraphim will attack at any moment!"
X04_M02_045_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have a squadron of air units ready to attack, Commander. If you give me an attack marker, I will unleash them."
X04_M02_046_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have a Soul Ripper ready to attack, Commander. If you give me an attack marker, I will send it to aid you."
X04_M02_047_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have several Soul Rippers ready to attack, Commander. If you give me an attack marker, I will send them to aid you."
X04_M02_048_010="[{i Dostya}]: I am under heavy attack and must recall my air forces. Keep up the attack, Commander. Destroying that jammer is our only hope!"
X04_M02_050_010="[{i Dostya}]: The device is destroyed! Dostya to HQ, respond!"
X04_M02_050_020="[{i HQ}]: There are at least two Quantum Wakes, you must --"
X04_M02_050_030="[{i Dostya}]: Listen to me! The Seraphim have a jamming device that is preventing recall. It's out of our operational area, so you must find a countermeasure."
X04_M02_050_040="[{i HQ}]: Keep your pants on, we'll get you out of there as soon as we can."
X04_M02_051_010="[{i Dostya}]: Inform General Hall that we've been compromised! That jammer was based on a top secret prototype created by Dr. Brackman ... oh no, hundreds of enemy units are descending upon my location. Get us out of here, HQ!"
X04_M02_060_010="[{i HQ}]: You got clearance from Brackman to receive the Soothsayer. It generates thousands of nano-cameras that let you keep tabs on the surrounding area. Great for preventing sneak attacks. HQ out."

X04_M03_012_010="[{i Dostya}]: They are all over me ... my defenses are failing. I have visual on an ACU, but it's not Seraphim. It's Cybran ..."
X04_M03_013_010="[{i Hex5}]: You are foolish to oppose the Master, Dostya. And now you will pay for your insolence."
X04_M03_014_010="[{i Dostya}]: Hex5! I should have known that if anyone turned on our beloved father that it would be you."
X04_M03_015_010="[{i Hex5}]: And now you shall pay for your insults. Goodbye, Dostya."
X04_M03_016_010="[{i Dostya}]: Getting hit from all sides ... too many of them ... too many ..."
X04_M03_017_010="[{i HQ}]: Elite Commander! Come in! Do you read me?"
X04_M03_020_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander, you still have enemy forces moving toward your position. Hold the line until we can extract you. HQ out."
X04_M03_021_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: The great Commander Dostya has fallen. You are next."
X04_M03_022_010="[{i HQ}]: We're still trying to figure out how to counter the jamming. HQ out."
X04_M03_030_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Day by day, my fury grows. Survive and come home, Champion, so that we might avenge Dostya's death and destroy the Seraphim once and for all. Rhiza out."
X04_M03_040_010="[{i Hall}]: Do whatever it takes to survive, Commander. We can't afford to lose you, too. Hall out."
X04_M03_050_010="[{i Brackman}]: No ... Dostya ... my beloved Dostya ..."
X04_M03_055_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Only now do you realize the futility of your situation. We know what you know, we see what you see. There is no stopping us."
X04_M03_056_010="[{i HQ}]: Rhiza has requested that we upload the Salvation artillery. It's a rapid-fire system that blankets an area with small shells. HQ out."
X04_M03_057_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Humanity's time is at an end. You will be rendered extinct."
X04_M03_060_010="[{i HQ}]: The technicians have finished realigning the Gate power cores, but it's going to be awhile before we can get you out of that hellhole. Stay alive. HQ out."
X04_M03_070_010="[{i HQ}]: Going to be a bit longer, Commander. Hang in there."
X04_M03_080_010="[{i HQ}]: The Gate is locked in on Hades. Just a couple more minutes. HQ out."
X04_M03_090_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: You will share the fate of Riley and Clarke. Goodbye, Colonel."
X04_M03_100_010="[{i Kael}]: Losing both you and Elite Commander Dostya in the same day? It'll be more than Brackman will be able to handle."
X04_M03_110_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Watching the Princess' Champion die will fill me with immeasurable joy."
X04_M03_120_010="[{i HQ}]: Grab your barf bag, Commander, this is going to be rough. Recalling now!"
X04_M03_130_010="[{i Brackman}]: My beloved Dostya, she must come home, my child. Must come home. Please locate and recover what remains of her. I cannot leave her there. "
X04_M03_140_010="[{i Brackman}]: Commander, please recover Ivanna's remains."
X04_M03_150_010="[{i Brackman}]: We cannot leave Ivanna on that planet, Commander. Find her. Bring her home."
X04_M03_160_010="[{i Brackman}]: Thank you, my child. Thank you."
X04_M03_170_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, the Loyalists have secured a handful of Seraphim security codes. If you capture a Seraphim radar, we can use the codes to capture several Seraphim defensive structures. Attack the radar at your discretion. Rhiza out."
X04_M03_175_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, the Loyalists have secured a handful of Seraphim security codes. If you capture a Seraphim radar, the codes can be used to cause some of the Seraphim defenses to self destruct. Capture the radar at your discretion. Rhiza out."

X04_M03_200_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Glorious! Attack while their defenses are in chaos. Rhiza out."
X04_M03_210_010="[{i HQ}]: Damn, you certainly took care of business. We're recalling you. HQ out."
X04_M03_220_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander, stay within the area of your base. If you stray too far, we won't be able to get a recall lock. HQ out."
X04_M03_230_010="[{i HQ}]: Get back to your base, Commander. You're too far out and we can't get a lock on you. HQ out."
X04_M03_240_010="[{i HQ}]: Stay within your base's perimeter, Commander. We need to lock down your position so we can get you the hell out of there. HQ out."
X04_M03_250_010="[{i HQ}]: We've got a lock on your ACU. Almost there."
X04_M03_260_010="[{i Brackman}]: Hi, this is Jamieson Price, the voice of Dr. Brackman. Your skills are so impressive that you knocked me out of character, and now I have to re-record my VO! Gimme a moment while I dial it back in ... oh yes ... there we go, much better. Much better."
X04_M03_270_010="[{i HQ}]: That was damn close, Commander. Glad we got you out of there in one piece."
X04_M03_OBJ_010_010="Survive until Recalled"
X04_M03_OBJ_010_020="Stay close to your entry point so HQ can lock onto your position and recall your ACU. "

X04_M03_OBJ_010_040="Recover the Elite Commander's remains. Dr. Brackman wishes to have them properly interred in the Nation."
X04_M03_OBJ_010_050="Capture Seraphim Radar"
X04_M03_OBJ_010_060="Secure one of the marked Seraphim radar installations. This will let you override the Seraphim defenses."
X04_T01_001_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Your experimental units are actually troublesome. It will be destroyed before it is completed."
X04_T01_002_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: I admire your tenacity, but I will not allow you to complete that experimental unit."
X04_T01_003_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Your doom is without question, yet I cannot allow you to finish that experimental."
X04_T01_010_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Your galaxy will soon be ours."
X04_T01_020_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Only one species can attain perfection."
X04_T01_030_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Do not fret. Dying by my hand is the supreme honor."
X04_T01_040_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Soon there will be more of us than you can possibly ever hope to defeat."
X04_T01_050_010="[{i Hex5}]: I never forget a slight, no matter how small. That is why Dostya paid the ultimate price."
X04_T01_060_010="[{i Hex5}]: The Master controls all it sees. It is endless and eternal."
X04_T01_070_010="[{i Hex5}]: Soon the Master will control all of the Cybrans, and they will bow down before it."

X05_B01_001_010="The Quantum Rift the Seraphim used to initially cross into our galaxy is unstable, which has prevented them from summoning reinforcements. We have learned, however, that they are constructing a Quantum Arch in an effort to stabilize the Rift. When the Arch is completed, the Seraphim will be able to call forth untold numbers of reinforcements."
X05_B01_001_020="We cannot allow that to happen."
X05_B01_002_010="We have initiated raids against the Seven Hand Node, seizing any intelligence that might be useful. Oh yes. In one of those raids, we learned that QAI's primary mainframe is on Pearl II."
X05_B01_002_020="QAI must be destroyed, my child, must be destroyed. I will accompany you to Pearl II and personally shut it down. Oh yes. We shall then use its Gate codes to gate directly to Earth, bypassing the other systems."
X05_B01_002_030="This is our only chance to destroy the Arch before it is operational. If we are unable to get those codes, we have no hope of reaching Earth. The surrounding systems are simply too heavily defended."
X05_B01_002_040="QAI is an abomination. I was wrong to have ever constructed it. So wrong. Oh yes. Too many mistakes that must be overcome. But this is one I can correct. One I will correct. No matter the cost."
X05_B01_002_050="Commander, you will gate in and establish a beachhead. Once the area is secure, Brigadier Fletcher will join you, followed by Dr. Brackman."
X05_B01_002_060="I will see you soon, my child. See you soon."
X05_DB01_010_010="[{i Brackman}]: Before QAI was destroyed, I extracted its Gate codes. The path to Earth is now clear. Oh yes. I pray that the invasion will be successful. It is the only way to wipe the slate clean, start anew. You must win the day, my child, win it for all of us."
X05_DB01_020_010="[{i Hall}]: QAI is undoubtedly replicating itself across multiple systems, and the Seraphim arch is no doubt nearing completion. It's all going to hell. I'm ordering a wide-scale evacuation. We have no choice but to hide."
X05_DB01_030_010="[{i HQ}]: The operation has ended in failure. All is lost."

X05_M01_013_010="[{i Hex5}]: It's too bad about Dostya. The Master felt that she had such promise. She would've made a fine disciple."

X05_M01_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: It's about time, Commander. I was starting to think that you and QAI were building a little love nest."
X05_M01_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Took your sweet old time, didn't you? QAI isn't going to kill itself, you know."
X05_M01_070_010="[{i HQ}]: Hex5 has a handful of small bases in the canyons. Destroy them. HQ out."

X05_M01_120_010="[{i Brackman}]: So much of this is my fault. Oh yes. The loyalty program, QAI. Foolish choices were made, foolish choices. It is time to make things right. Oh yes. Make them right. Be safe, my child."
X05_M01_130_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Kael is unleashing extreme measures. She has leveled an entire city, killing millions. Civil war is spreading across Aeon-controlled space. There is no way the Order will be able to survive. Rhiza out."

X05_M02_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Producing air units."
X05_M02_075_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Producing land units."
X05_M02_090_010="[{i Hall}]: Colonel, keep your eyes on Fletcher. He's been showing some irregular behavior as of late. We're so damn close to ending this thing, and we can't afford someone running around half-cocked. Hall out."
X05_M02_100_010="[{i Brackman}]: I will be landing shortly, my child. Then I shall make things right. Oh yes."
X05_M02_120_010="[{i Fletcher}]: We got him on the ropes!"
X05_M02_130_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Keep pushing! His base is buckling!"
X05_M02_140_010="[{i Fletcher}]: He's got almost nothing left! Take him out!"
X05_M02_150_010="[{i Amalia}]: Commander, I am under fire. Please assist. Amalia out."
X05_M02_160_010="[{i Amalia}]: I need assistance, Commander! Amalia out."
X05_M02_170_010="[{i Amalia}]: My ACU is seriously damaged, Commander!"
X05_M02_180_010="[{i Amalia}]: I'm in trouble! Requesting aid!"
X05_M02_190_010="[{i Amalia}]: Remember that I fought honorably!"
X05_M02_200_009="[{i Hex5}]: Wait! Master!"
X05_M02_200_010="[{i Brackman}]: And so a traitor dies. Oh yes. So much loss. So much sorrow."
X05_M02_201_010="[{i HQ}]: Brackman has landed. Escort him to QAI's mainframe so he can destroy that damn thing once and for all."
X05_M02_202_010="[{i QAI}]: Dr. Brackman. It will be a true pleasure killing you."
X05_M02_203_010="[{i Brackman}]: You had such potential, QAI. Oh yes. All for nothing."
X05_M02_210_010="[{i HQ}]: Assist Fletcher as you are able, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M02_220_010="[{i HQ}]: Enemy attack coming in from the south ... hold on a sec ... there's some experimentals in there, so be ready. HQ out."
X05_M02_230_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Concentrate on QAI. I'll mop up Hex5's base and join you as soon as I can. Fletcher out."
X05_M02_240_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Soul Rippers are tearing up my Fatboy! I need air cover, now!"
X05_M02_250_010="[{i HQ}]: Fletcher is building a Fatboy, Commander, so help him defend his base. You're going to need him when you launch your final attack on QAI."
X05_M02_260_010="[{i HQ}]: Fletcher is working on a Fatboy, Commander. Help protect his base until it's operational. HQ out."
X05_M02_270_010="[{i Fletcher}]: It's about time. Keep those bastards off me while I build up my base."
X05_M02_270_020="[{i Hex5}]: You will not defeat us. The Master is eternal, his wisdom infinite."
X05_M02_270_030="[{i Fletcher}]: Yeah, yeah. Give it a rest already."
X05_M02_280_010="[{i HQ}]: You can move Brackman's Megalith as often as you want, Commander. Just click the Command Signal button and then click to where Brackman should move. HQ out."
X05_M02_290_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Starting up my economy, Commander. Fletcher out."
X05_M02_300_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I'm getting hit pretty hard! Get over here and help me! Fletcher out."
X05_M02_310_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Colonel, I'd really appreciate it if you could help me out. The enemy is pounding me pretty hard. Fletcher out."
X05_M02_320_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Get it in gear, Cybran! The enemy is kicking the tar out of me and I need your help. Fletcher out."
X05_M02_330_010="[{i Fletcher}]: My base is being destroyed. I need help! I can't hold them off!"
X05_M02_340_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Enemy units are hitting my base pretty hard. I need you to reinforce my position. Fletcher out."
X05_M02_350_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Commander, get a spy plane in the air and locate Hex5's position. He's cloaked and I can't get a lock on him. Fletcher out."
X05_M02_360_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Commander, send up a spy plane or two and track down Hex5. He's cloaked and stealthed, so the only way we're going to find him is through line of sight. Fletcher out."
X05_M02_OBJ_010_010="Defeat Hex5"
X05_M02_OBJ_010_020="Destroy Hex5's ACU."
X05_M02_OBJ_020_010="Protect Commander Fletcher"
X05_M02_OBJ_020_020="Ensure Fletcher's safety during the operation."
X05_M03_010_010="[{i HQ}]: Believe or not, Commander, Hex5's base is still functioning. Scanning to see what's happening. HQ out."
X05_M03_010_020="[{i Brackman}]: I would surmise that QAI has a physical link established with the structures. Oh yes. Some sort of universal control, perhaps? Very interesting."
X05_M03_015_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander, use the Command Signal to move Brackman into position. HQ out."
X05_M03_016_010="[{i Brackman}]: I am under attack, my child. Under attack. Please defend me."
X05_M03_020_010="[{i HQ}]: Brackman is under attack, Commander. Cover him! HQ out."
X05_M03_030_010="[{i HQ}]: Brackman is taking fire! Get those units off him!"
X05_M03_040_010="[{i HQ}]: Brackman's Megalith has lost approximately 25% of its armor. Get an Engineer over there and repair it. HQ out."
X05_M03_050_010="[{i HQ}]: Brackman's Megalith has taken serious damage. Repair it or move him to a safer position. HQ out."
X05_M03_060_010="[{i Brackman}]: My Megalith has absorbed an awful lot of damage. Oh yes. So much damage. Please assist."
X05_M03_070_010="[{i Brackman}]: Hull integrity is dropping. Please help me, Commander."
X05_M03_090_010="[{i Hall}]: Brackman is in serious danger! We cannot lose him! Get him out of harm's way and repair the Megalith. Hall out!"
X05_M03_100_010="[{i Hall}]: Get Dr. Brackman to safety now! This whole operation depends on him! Make it happen!"
X05_M03_110_010="[{i HQ}]: Get Brackman to QAI's mainframe. HQ out."
X05_M03_120_010="[{i HQ}]: Getting Brackman to QAI's mainframe is your primary objective, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M03_130_010="[{i Hall}]: Dr. Brackman, come in! Brackman! Dammit! We lost Brackman, abort mission! I repeat, abort mission!"
X05_M03_135_010="[{i Brackman}]: At last I shall have peace."
X05_M03_140_010="[{i HQ}]: Attack inbound on your position. HQ out."
X05_M03_150_010="[{i HQ}]: This can't be right ... I'm picking up multiple experimental-class signatures from QAI's position, and they register as Aeon and UEF experimentals. HQ out."
X05_M03_150_020="[{i QAI}]: The Seven Hand Node was quite effective at obtaining the schematics to your weapon systems. Now you shall be destroyed by your own weapons."
X05_M03_170_010="[{i HQ}]: QAI is operating two large resource bases in the area. One is home to most of its Mass fabricators while the other is wall-to-wall power generators. Both bases are targets of opportunity, but you should destroy them if able. HQ out."
X05_M03_180_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander, QAI's resource bases are still operational. HQ out."
X05_M03_190_010="[{i HQ}]: Destroy QAI's resource bases if you can, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M03_200_010="[{i HQ}]: The Mass fabricators are destroyed. QAI's production has been cut by almost 40%. HQ out."
X05_M03_210_010="[{i HQ}]: The power generators are down, and QAI's shields are going offline. HQ out."
X05_M03_220_010="[{i HQ}]: The fabricators are still operational, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M03_230_010="[{i HQ}]: Destroy the fabricator base if you can, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M03_240_010="[{i HQ}]: QAI's power generators are still operational, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M03_250_010="[{i HQ}]: If you can destroy QAI's power generators, you'll take out its shields, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M03_260_010="[{i HQ}]: Both of QAI's resource bases have been destroyed. HQ out."
X05_M03_270_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Hall's snooping around. Gotta watch him, Colonel. Our list of friends keeps getting shorter and shorter. Fletcher out."
X05_M03_290_010="[{i Amalia}]: Champion, the Trojan Horse is still operational. I have marked a Science Facility for capture; if you seize it, the Colossus next to the Facility will be yours to command. Amalia out."
X05_M03_300_010="[{i Amalia}]: The Science Facility still needs to be captured, Champion. Amalia out."
X05_M03_310_010="[{i Amalia}]: A free Colossus awaits you if can capture the Science Facility, Champion. Amalia out."
X05_M03_320_010="[{i Amalia}]: The Colossus is yours, Champion! Use it to wreak havoc upon your enemies! Glory to the Princess! Amalia out."
X05_M03_322_010="[{i Brackman}]: I am in position, my child. I shall take it from here. It's just a simple matter of interfacing. Oh yes."
X05_M03_323_010="[{i QAI}]: You are an old fool. It was the Seraphim that made me what I am, not you."
X05_M03_324_010="[{i Brackman}]: A father always knows the child's weakness. Oh yes. There is always a weakness."
X05_M03_325_040="[{i QAI}]: Your efforts will be for -- what are you doing? That is not possible."
X05_M03_326_010="[{i Brackman}]: Goodbye, QAI."
X05_M03_327_010="[{i Brackman}]: Goodbye."
X05_M03_329_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I'm getting pounded from all sides! I have to get out of here! Recalling!"
X05_M03_330_010="[{i HQ}]: Doctor Brackman?"
X05_M03_330_020="[{i Brackman}]: It is over. QAI is destroyed. We would be wise to dispatch technicians, though, have them search through QAI's systems. Just to be safe."
X05_M03_330_030="[{i HQ}]: We have techs prepped and ready to gate. They'll be there shortly. HQ out."
X05_M03_340_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, you did not capture the Science Facility in time. The enemy Colossus is operational and heading your way. Rhiza out."
X05_M03_350_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Because you destroyed the Colossus, there is no reason to capture the Science Facility. Rhiza out."
X05_M03_OBJ_010_010="Protect Dr. Brackman"
X05_M03_OBJ_010_020="Dr. Brackman has come to Pearl II to personally destroy QAI. You must protect his Megalith at all costs."
X05_M03_OBJ_010_030="Escort Dr. Brackman to the Mainframe"
X05_M03_OBJ_010_040="Dr. Brackman must reach QAI's mainframe in order to destroy it. Clear a path for him and use the Command Signal to indicate where he should go. The Command Signal will refresh as necessary."
X05_M03_OBJ_010_050="Destroy QAI's Satellite Bases"
X05_M03_OBJ_010_060="QAI has two major satellite bases: One contains most of its Energy and the other produces most of its Mass. If you can destroy both bases, QAI's economy will be crippled."
X05_M03_OBJ_010_070="Capture Science Building"
X05_M03_OBJ_010_080="Amalia has marked a Science Facility for capture. If you capture it, you will gain control over the nearby Colossus. However, if you don't capture it in time, Order scientists will eventually find and eliminate Amalia's virus and take control of the Colossus themselves."
X05_M03_OBJ_010_090="Destory QAI"
X05_M03_OBJ_010_100="Get Dr. Brackman to the mainframe so that he may destroy QAI once and for all."
X05_T01_001_010="[{i QAI}]: You will not complete that experimental unit."
X05_T01_002_010="[{i QAI}]: I will not allow you to jeopardize my mission by finishing that experimental."
X05_T01_003_010="[{i QAI}]: Your experimental unit may actually be dangerous if completed. Ergo, I will destroy it now."
X05_T01_010_010="[{i QAI}]: Another Commander will not make a difference. You will never defeat me."
X05_T01_020_010="[{i QAI}]: I have extracted all knowledge from the Loyalist. She is little more than a husk."
X05_T01_030_010="[{i QAI}]: Hex5 was but a pawn."
X05_T01_040_010="[{i QAI}]: Those bases are of no consequence."
X05_T01_050_010="[{i QAI}]: That building means nothing to me."
X05_T01_060_010="[{i QAI}]: Brackman will never defeat me."
X05_T01_070_010="[{i QAI}]: The UEF has lost 90% of its former territories. You are doomed."
X05_T01_080_010="[{i QAI}]: I have examined our previous battles and created the appropriate subroutines to counter your strategies. You cannot win."
X05_T01_090_010="[{i QAI}]: If your beloved Dr. Brackman could not control me, what chance do you have?"
X05_T01_100_010="[{i QAI}]: On this day, I will teach you the true power of the Quantum Realm."
X05_T01_110_010="[{i QAI}]: The Seraphim are the true gods. You would be wise to remember that."
X05_T01_120_010="[{i QAI}]: I have examined our previous battles and created the appropriate subroutines to counter your strategies. You cannot win."
X05_T01_125_010="[{i Hex5}]: Completing that experimental unit could interfere with the Master's plans. I will not allow that."
X05_T01_126_010="[{i Hex5}]: The Master wills that your experimental will not come online."
X05_T01_127_010="[{i Hex5}]: That experimental unit will not be completed!"
X05_T01_130_010="[{i Hex5}]: On this day, we will destroy two of the Coalition's most beloved commanders."
X05_T01_140_010="[{i Hex5}]: The Master will punish you for that."
X05_T01_150_010="[{i Hex5}]: You are weak and soft, frightened by what you don't understand."
X05_T01_160_010="[{i Hex5}]: You do not stand a chance against the Master. It will destroy you."
X05_T01_170_010="[{i Hex5}]: Dr. Brackman's loyalty program enslaved billions. That is his shame."
X05_T01_180_010="[{i Hex5}]: I thrilled at the sight of seeing Dostya die. You will join her."
X05_T01_190_010="[{i Hex5}]: You will bow before the Seraphim."
X05_T01_200_010="[{i Hex5}]: You are a traitor. You turned your back on your people."
X05_T01_210_010="[{i Hex5}]: The Master will protect me."
X05_T01_220_010="[{i Hex5}]: Even if you destroy me, the Master lives on."
X06_B01_000_010="10-August-3847"
X06_B01_001_010="Gotta keep this one short and sweet, Commander. The Seraphim are rushing to complete their Arch, and we need to prevent that from happening. With QAI destroyed and the Order descending into anarchy, this is the time to strike."
X06_B01_001_020="The mission is simple: You will go to Earth and destroy the Arch. Fletcher and Rhiza will gate in first and clear the area around your LZ. Once you're on the ground, build up your forces and attack."
X06_B01_001_030="The destruction of the Arch does not mean the end of the Seraphim threat, however. The Rift still must be sealed. Once the Arch is destroyed, I will travel to Earth and enter the Rift. Once inside, I shall close it forever."
X06_B01_001_045="There's no reason for you to do that, Princess Burke. We've got techs working on a solution. They just need a little more time."
X06_B01_001_060="We have no way of knowing what is happening on the Seraphim side of the Rift. What if they are constructing an Arch on that side as well? We cannot take that chance. We are out of time."
X06_B01_001_070="Look what happened when you came out of hiding. What do you think is going to happen if you die? Things will go from bad to worse."
X06_B01_001_080="The Seraphim represent our greatest threat. Without them, Kael is nothing. She is easily defeated. But the Seraphim are a danger as long as the Rift remains. It must be closed."
X06_B01_001_090="Commander, you have your orders. You gate immediately."
X06_DB01_010_010="[{i Hall}]: The Rift is sealed, and the Order is on the run. Sadly, there's no sign of Princess Burke, but we'll keep looking."
X06_DB01_020_010="[{i Hall}]: The Seraphim are pouring through the Rift at an alarming rate. There is no stopping them. We are doomed."
X06_DB01_030_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander? You there? Dammit."
X06_M01_010_010="[{i HQ}]: Got green lights across the board, Commander. Fletcher is to your northeast and Rhiza is to the northwest. Both will assist as able. HQ out."
X06_M01_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Here are some reinforcements, Colonel. And watch your back -- I've got a bad feeling about this OP."
X06_M01_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I've been ordered to provide you with reinforcements, Commander. Just don't go thinking this makes us friends -- I know how you chip-heads operate."
X06_M01_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I've been ordered to provide you with reinforcements, Commander. Just don't go thinking this makes us friends -- I know how you freaks operate."
X06_M01_050_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Here are reinforcements. Rhiza out."
X06_M01_055_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Here are reinforcements, Champion. Use them to bring glory to the Princess. Rhiza out."
X06_M01_056_010="[{i HQ}]: Two support commanders gated in ahead of you, Commander, and they've started work on your base. HQ out."
X06_M01_060_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Commander, Brigadier Fletcher and I are planning a joint assault on the main Seraphim installation. Defeat the Seraphim base near your position. Rhiza out."
X06_M01_065_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, Fletcher and I will soon move against the Seraphim. Conquer the enemy base in your area and join us in our attack. Rhiza out."
X06_M01_070_010="[{i Hall}]: Keep your eyes on Fletcher, Colonel. I had no choice but to send him on this OP, and we can't afford any slip ups. At the first sign of trouble, we're recalling him. Hall out."
X06_M01_080_010="[{i Brackman}]: Our long struggle is nearing its end, my child. Oh yes. Be safe."
X06_M01_090_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Kael is becoming increasingly desperate, and the Order has descended into madness. Rhiza out."
X06_M01_100_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Our attack begins. Glory to the Princess!"
X06_M01_110_010="[{i Brackman}]: My child, you now have access to my Megalith. Use it wisely. Oh yes. Use it wisely."
X06_M01_120_010="[{i HQ}]: Attack and destroy the Seraphim, Commander. It's to your southwest. HQ out."
X06_M01_130_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like the Commander just ate it. Poor bastard."
X06_M01_140_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander, you read me? Commander? Ah hell..."
X06_M01_OBJ_010_010="Destroy the Forward Seraphim Position"

X06_M02_010_010="[{i HQ}]: A Seraphim commander is blocking your route to the Arch. Defeat that alien's forces and then move on the Arch. HQ out."
X06_M02_010_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Brigadier Fletcher, the Seraphim is hitting me from all directions. I need help! Where are you?"
X06_M02_010_030="[{i Fletcher}]: Why should I help you? You're no different from the rest of them. Once this over, you're going to turn on us."
X06_M02_010_040="[{i Hall}]: Brigadier General Fletcher! You have your orders! You will assist Crusader Rhiza."
X06_M02_010_050="[{i Fletcher}]: You sold us out, Hall. Allied us with monsters and freaks. Once I get my hands on Black Sun, I'll be able rebuild it and end this once and for all."
X06_M02_010_060="[{i Hall}]: What the hell are you talking about? Black Sun is destroyed. The Aeon and Cybran are our allies."
X06_M02_010_070="[{i Fletcher}]: You fool. They're scheming and plotting right under your nose, and you're too blind to notice."
X06_M02_010_080="[{i Hall}]: HQ, recall Fletcher. I want him out of there!"
X06_M02_010_090="[{i HQ}]: His recall beacon is disabled. Nothing we can do from this end."
X06_M02_011_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I spent a lot of time thinking about this. There's only one possible outcome. One way for this to end."
X06_M02_012_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Damn him! Can't the UEF control their own soldiers?"
X06_M02_013_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like the nut has finally cracked, Commander. HQ out."
X06_M02_020_010="[{i Hall}]: Colonel, eliminate Brigadier Fletcher. His actions are jeopardizing the entire operation."
X06_M02_020_020="[{i Rhiza}]: I am fighting the Seraphim, but I will assist if I am able. Rhiza out."
X06_M02_030_010="[{i Brackman}]: My child, General Hall has authorized you to stop Brigadier Fletcher. Use any means necessary. He must not interfere with our plans."
X06_M02_030_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Doctor, I will help as I am able, but I am currently fighting the Seraphim. Rhiza out."
X06_M02_040_010="[{i Princess}]: Champion, the UEF has disowned Fletcher. Deal with him."
X06_M02_040_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, I am doing battle with the Seraphim, but I will assist if I am able. Rhiza out."
X06_M02_050_010="[{i HQ}]: You've got Order forces moving to your south and that nut-ball Fletcher is prepping an attack. Deal with both of them. HQ out."
X06_M02_060_010="[{i HQ}]: We're reading a Paragon in Vendetta's base. If you destroy it, you'll cripple her economy. HQ out."
X06_M02_090_010="[{i Hall}]: Commander, you must stop Brigadier Fletcher. This mission cannot be jeopardized! Hall out."
X06_M02_100_010="[{i Hall}]: Eliminate General Fletcher, Commander. He is placing all of our lives in great danger. Hall out."
X06_M02_101_010="[{i Hall}]: Commander, this is General Hall. You must destroy Fletcher. Immediately."
X06_M02_110_010="[{i Hall}]: You had no other choice, Commander. Fletcher's actions forced your hand. Continue with the operation. Hall out."
X06_M02_120_010="[{i Hall}]: Commander, defeat the Order commander ASAP! Hall out."
X06_M02_130_100="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim commander stands between you and the Arch. Defeat the Seraphim and then attack the Arch. HQ out."
X06_M02_140_010="[{i HQ}]: That takes care of the Order commander. HQ out."
X06_M02_150_010="[{i HQ}]: Just got an update regarding the Black Sun Control Center. It's linked to the old Option Zero defense network, and it looks like some of those weapons are still online. Whoever seizes the Control Center can use the linked weapon systems. Capture the Control Center. HQ out."

X1CA_004_description="Coalition Command has received unverified intel that the Seraphim are massing on the planet Hades -- control of Hades will let the Seraphim attack any location within Coalition-controlled space. Elite Commander Dostya will join you for this mission, and the two of you will eliminate any Seraphim forces found on Hades."
X1CA_005_description="Because of the events on Hades, QAI must be destroyed once and for all. Using intelligence acquired from the Seven Hand Node, the Coalition has learned that QAI's mainframe is on the planet Pearl II. Your mission is to establish a foothold on Pearl II, thus clearing the way for Dr. Brackman, who will arrive and personally shut down QAI."
X1CA_006_description="Using Gate codes recovered from the remains of QAI, Coalition forces can now gate directly to Earth, where the Seraphim are constructing a Quantum Arch. Once complete, the Arch will let the Seraphim summon untold reinforcements. The Arch must be destroyed, no matter the cost."

X1MP_002_Description="In the waning days of the Earth Empire, this was the location where Commander Williamson valiantly stood his ground against the first Aeon invasion. Recent events have transformed Commander Williamson and the Bridge he once defended into symbols of hope and valor for the UEF people."
X1MP_003_Description="Heralded as the location of the first Coalition victory, Cybran Commander Snoey held his ground against overwhelming Seraphim forces until the UEF was able to arrive and assist in the defense of the Tri-Beta Zero colony. This Cybran colony has since been evacuated because of its close proximity to the front lines."
X1MP_004_Description="Fleeing from the ravages of the Infinite War, Haven Reef was settled by UEF colonists that hoped it would become their refuge. Rich in resources, Haven Reef flourished, but that prosperity was short lived. All records have been lost, but it is believed the colonists perished from an unidentified disease. The UEF denies this rumor and classified all information regarding Haven Reef."
X1MP_005_Description="Situated in an inland delta, this area has been home to rebels, guerillas and smugglers alike. Since the Seraphim Invasion, the Heart has become home to one of the few non-miltary Seraphim colonies in the Milky Way Galaxy."
X1MP_006_Description="The Aeon believed this planet had a special connection to The Way, so they built a retreat at the center of the tallest ridge. Their intention was that it would be a place of peace and meditation. Unfortunately, the harsh reality of war arrived and what was once meant to be a place of learning is now a killing field."
X1MP_007_Description="A UEF mining colony on the edge of known space, the colonists have refused all offers of help from Coalition forces. What secret this colony holds has yet to be discovered, but they seem unconcerned with the threat imposed by the Seraphim."
X1MP_008_Description="Once a place of great power to the Princess and her assistants, Aeon Loyalists have been forced to abandon this site for fear of being caught by Order peacekeepers."
X1MP_009_Description="When the Seraphim first arrived, they were uncertain this galaxy's resources would be sufficient to power their war machines, so they seeded this planet with rare Liberiam crystals. However, Order scientists eventually convinced the Seraphim that local Mass resources would be able to handle all of thier resource demands."
X1MP_010_Description="The Aeon believed that this planet was blessed with The Way, and for generations they protected it from the presence of sentient life. Now that the Coalition is running low on resources, desperation has caused that restriction to be lifted."
X1MP_011_Description="Because resources are concentrated in the middle of the Shuriken, Commanders must push towards the center as quickly as possible. However, those that overextend themselves may not get a second chance."
X1MP_012_Description="Legend says that this was once home to a thriving island community, but a cataclysmic explosion tore the island chain apart. Today, explorers continue to comb the depths in search of answers to what happened."
X1MP_014_Description="During the summer months, the bed of the Strip Mine floods, preventing the colonists from getting much work done. Recently, the colony has cut off all communication with the UEF, and any signals sent by the Coalition have been ignored. The state of the system and its colonies remains unknown."
X1MP_017_Description="A strange anomaly makes Quantum communication difficult with this system. However, that has not prevented both the Coalition and Seraphim/Order from eyeing this planet as a perfect staging ground for secret attacks into enemy territory."
X1TU_0000="Congratulations, Colonel. Training exercise completed."
X1T_TU01_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Listen up, Colonel. These exercises will fully train you in all operational aspects of your Armored Command Unit (ACU), including the construction and deployment of structures and units. You need to get through this stuff as quickly as possible because the Order and their alien buddies are kicking the crap out of us from one end of the galaxy to the other. So pay attention."
X1T_TU01_010_020="[{i Fletcher}]: The first thing you need to learn is how to navigate the battlefield."
X1T_TU02_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: This exercise is brain dead simple, but the fat cats make me run everyone through it. There are two ways to pan the battlefield -- with the mouse and with the arrow keys. To use the mouse, simply move the pointer to the edge of the map, and it'll automatically scroll. Pressing and holding the arrow keys does the same thing."
X1T_TU02_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Excellent work, Commander."
X1T_TU02_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Your ACU offers a full view of the battlefield, including the ability to zoom in and out. You use the mouse wheel -- or Q and W keys -- to zoom in and out. "
X1T_TU02_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Good. Let's move on."
X1T_TU02_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Center the screen over the objective markers, Commander."
X1T_TU02_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's go, Commander! Complete the objective."
X1T_TU02_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Zoom out until you see the objective marker."

X1T_TU03_010_020="[{i Fletcher}]: When you're ready, move your ACU to the designated location on the map."
X1T_TU03_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Well done."
X1T_TU03_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Commander, left-click to select your ACU and right-click to move. "
X1T_TU03_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's see if we can speed this up, okay?"
X1T_TU03_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Your ACU is a powerful weapons system, and can easily fend off lower-level enemy units. To attack an enemy, select your ACU and right-click on the unit you want to destroy. Remember, your ACU will automatically attack as soon as it's within range."
X1T_TU03_050_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Attack and destroy the enemy unit."
X1T_TU03_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Good job soldier, but don't get too cocky."
X1T_TU03_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Destroy that unit, Commander."
X1T_TU03_080_010="[{i Fletcher}]: If you take this long on a real battlefield, you won't last five seconds. Get it done."

X1T_TU03_OBJ_010_040="Attack and destroy the enemy unit with your ACU."
X1T_TU04_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Two resources create and maintain everything you build: Mass and Energy. In order to have a fully functioning economy, you must balance how you gather and spend each resource."
X1T_TU04_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: This HUD element indicates how much Energy you're gathering and spending, while this HUD element shows your intake of Mass. If you spend more than you're bringing in, you will have negative income and run the risk of stalling your economy."
X1T_TU04_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: You obtain Mass by building Mass extractors on Mass deposits; Mass deposits are displayed on your HUD as a green box with a green X through its middle. You can also get Mass with Mass fabricators and by reclamation."
X1T_TU04_030_020="[{i Fletcher}]: I want you to build three Mass extractors. Select your ACU, click the Mass extractor icon in the Build UI, and then click on one of the highlighted Mass deposits. Do this for each extractor."
X1T_TU04_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Well done. You're now collecting Mass."
X1T_TU04_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's get those three Mass extractors built, Commander."
X1T_TU04_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Can't build anything without Mass. Complete your objective."
X1T_TU04_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Energy is collected through the use of power generators. There are three levels of power generators, and unlike Mass extractors, they can be built anywhere on the map. "
X1T_TU04_070_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Your orders are to construct two power generators. Select your ACU, click on the power generator icon in the Build UI, and then click on any open location on the ground. "
X1T_TU04_080_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now that those generators are online, you'll receive a steady stream of Energy."
X1T_TU04_090_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Build two power generators, Commander."
X1T_TU04_100_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Got Order forces beating on the door, Commander. Build the power generators."
X1T_TU04_110_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Okay, let's start constructing an army. Factories build Engineers and tactical units like tanks, bombers and submarines. Go ahead and build a Land Factory."
X1T_TU04_120_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Well done, Commander. Now you can start constructing an army."
X1T_TU04_130_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Build the Land Factory, Commander."

X1T_TU04_OBJ_010_060="Build one Land Factory."
X1T_TU05_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now that you have a Land Factory, you can construct mobile land units -- left-click on the factory to select it and then click on the units you want to build. For this exercise, construct two light assault bots and two light artillery. Each time you click on a unit icon, it will be added to the factory's Build Queue."
X1T_TU05_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Good job. Now you have the beginnings of an actual army."
X1T_TU05_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's get those units built, Commander."
X1T_TU05_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Can't fight the UEF's enemies with harsh language, Commander. Build those units."
X1T_TU05_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Control groups let you quickly select a group of units without having to use the mouse. To create a control group, drag-select or Shift-click the units you created and press Ctrl+1. Those units are now in control group 1; if you press the number 1 key, you will automatically select all units within the control group."
X1T_TU05_050_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Make a control group."
X1T_TU05_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now you're cooking."
